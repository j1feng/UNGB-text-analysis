1,2010,"PSE","It gives 
me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his 
election to the presidency at this session and to wish 
him every success in fulfilling his important tasks. We 
would also like to convey through you, Sir, our thanks 
to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his 
valuable efforts during his presidency of the General 
Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. 
 We would like also to express our thanks and 
appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in strengthening the 
role and work of the United Nations and its bodies in 
various fields. In particular, we greatly appreciate his 
efforts, and those of the United Nations entities, 
especially the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which 
continues to work to provide essential services to 
Palestinian refugees, who have been waiting for more 
than 60 years for redress of their plight and the 
realization of their right to return to their homes and 
properties. 
 I am well aware that the agenda of the General 
Assembly is filled with matters and issues of pressing 
concern to the entire human race and to our planet, 
particularly those relating to armed conflict, wars and 
the struggle of people under foreign occupation to 
realize their right to self-determination, as well as 
climate change, global warming, natural disasters and 
the global economic and financial crises. 
 All of this is happening at a time when we are 
witnessing rightful demands for the revitalization of 
the United Nations, particularly reform of the Security 
Council aimed at making it more representative and 
truly reflective of the current international situation. 
This is especially important in the light of the 
  
 
10-55103 30 
 
emergence of new Powers, which should be 
represented in the Security Council in order to enhance 
its role and effectiveness in maintaining international 
peace and security. 
 There is also significant discontent over some 
States’ non-compliance with Security Council and 
General Assembly resolutions. This demands that the 
international community take vigorous, effective 
measures to compel those countries to respect and 
implement these resolutions; to end colonization, 
occupation and exploitation in our world so as to 
promote the values of freedom, justice, tolerance and 
coexistence; and to combat extremism and terrorism. 
Indeed, the United Nations has a fundamental role to 
play in promoting cooperative relations among peoples 
and guiding them towards investment in the 
development of societies and infrastructure, as well as 
in fighting poverty, unemployment, desertification, 
disease and epidemics and the lethal human and 
environmental risks they pose for humanity and the 
future of our planet. 
 Our people, our homeland, Palestine, and our 
region, the Middle East, are facing extremely serious 
problems that continue to push them towards violence 
and conflict, wasting chance after chance to seriously 
address the issues faced by the peoples of the region 
and to arrive at comprehensive and bold solutions. This 
is the result of the expansionist and hegemonic 
mentality that still prevails in the ideology and policies 
of Israel, the occupying Power, whose standard policy 
is non-compliance with internationally legitimate 
resolutions, including those of the General Assembly 
and the Security Council. Such disrespect has rendered 
those resolutions ineffective, undermined the 
credibility of the United Nations and bolstered the 
prevailing view that double standards are in effect, 
particularly regarding the Palestinian question, and that 
Israel is a State above the law, flouting all these 
resolutions and engaging in oppression, arrests, 
detentions, killings, destruction, demolition of homes, 
blockades, settlement expansion and the establishment 
of the annexation apartheid wall, violating and 
undermining the existence and the rights of our people 
in their own homeland. 
 The ancient city of East Jerusalem, capital of the 
independent State of Palestine and designated by 
UNESCO as a world heritage site requiring protection, 
is being subjected by Israel, the occupying Power, to 
actions that alter and distort realities on the ground. 
Such actions destroy landmarks, cemeteries and the 
religious, spiritual and historical identity of the holy 
city in every aspect and as quickly as possible, aiming 
to erase its historical character and pre-empt final 
status negotiations. This is in addition to the 
continuous excavations under the Al-Aqsa mosque, the 
demolition of homes, the deportations and revocation 
of the residency rights of its population and the 
imposition of a siege on the city in an attempt to isolate 
it from its natural Palestinian Arab surroundings and to 
control it geographically and demographically. 
 This situation is a provocation to our people. It 
antagonizes them and gives rise to anger, especially in 
the Arab and Islamic world. It creates instability in our 
region and constitutes a serious obstacle to the 
achievement of peace and security. All of these illegal 
Israeli measures and practices must cease. 
 This is also the case with regard to the situation 
in the Gaza Strip, which has been subjected to an 
unjust, illegal and unprecedented land, air and sea 
blockade in violation of international law and United 
Nations resolutions. It is also the target of harsh Israeli 
military aggression that has severely damaged its 
infrastructure. This illegal blockade and aggression 
have resulted in the destruction of the infrastructure 
and productive capacity of Gaza and destroyed 25 per 
cent of its homes and nearly 75 per cent of its jobs, 
leading to widespread unemployment and dependence 
on international aid. The Israeli blockade is preventing 
our people in Gaza from rebuilding their homes, even 
though the international donor community has pledged 
some $5 billion to finance reconstruction. The 
blockade against the Gaza Strip must be lifted 
immediately and completely, and the tragic suffering 
being inflicted on our people there must be ended as 
soon as possible. 
 We welcome the efforts of the international 
independent fact-finding mission established by the 
Human Rights Council concerning the Israeli attack on 
the Freedom Flotilla, which was carrying humanitarian 
assistance for our people in the Gaza Strip. We 
welcome the conclusions reached by the mission, and 
we also look forward to the submission by the Panel of 
Inquiry established by the Secretary-General of its 
findings to the Security Council. 
 To all of this I must add the fact that thousands of 
Palestinian prisoners and detainees remain in Israeli 
jails and detention centres. They are all fighting for 
 
 
31 10-55103 
 
freedom. They must be released and an end must be put 
to their suffering. This is essential for creating a 
positive environment for the attainment of peace. We 
cannot reach a peace agreement that does not liberate 
all of them from their chains and their imprisonment. 
 In spite of all of this and despite the historic 
injustice that has been inflicted upon our people, their 
desire to achieve a just peace that guarantees the 
realization of their national rights in freedom and 
independence has not and will not diminish. Our 
wounded hands are still able to carry the olive branch 
picked from the splinters of the trees that the 
occupation forces uproot every day. Our people aspire 
to live in security, peace and stability on their 
Palestinian national soil, to build the lives and future of 
our generations. 
 We are willing and ready to reach a 
comprehensive, just and lasting peace, based on rights 
and justice and on the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. Such a settlement must lead to the 
withdrawal of Israel, the occupying Power, from all the 
Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, 
including East Jerusalem, so that the State of Palestine, 
with East Jerusalem as their capital, can enjoy 
independence and sovereignty and so that peace can 
prevail throughout the Middle East. 
 Because of our genuine desire to attain a 
comprehensive peace in the region, we have decided to 
enter into final status negotiations. We will exert every 
effort to reach an agreement for Palestinian-Israeli 
peace within one year, in accordance with the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace 
Initiative, the road map and the vision of the two-State 
solution. On behalf of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, we have reaffirmed our commitment to 
the option of just peace and our determination, 
seriousness and sincere intention to make these 
negotiations succeed, in spite of all the difficulties and 
obstacles before us. 
 The international community should draw lessons 
from the reasons for the faltering of the political 
process and the inability to achieve its goals in the 
past. Restoring the credibility of the peace process 
mainly requires compelling the Government of Israel 
to comply with its obligations and commitments. In 
particular, the Government of Israel must cease all 
settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian 
territory, especially in and around East Jerusalem; 
dismantle the apartheid annexation wall; and put an 
end to the policy of blockade and closures that restrict 
the lives and movement of our people and deprive them 
of their basic human rights. 
 Our demands for the freezing of settlement 
activities, the lifting of the blockade and an end to all 
other illegal Israeli practices do not constitute 
preconditions that are alien to the political process. 
Rather, they are consistent with the implementation of 
previous obligations and commitments which have 
been repeatedly reaffirmed in all the resolutions 
adopted since the start of the political process. 
 Israel’s implementation of these obligations and 
commitments will lead to the creation of the necessary 
environment for the success of the negotiations and 
will give credibility to its pledge to implement the final 
agreement. Israel must choose between peace and the 
continuation of settlements. 
 From this rostrum, I reaffirm that we will 
continue, as we have always done, to make every 
possible effort so that these negotiations will achieve 
the desired objective of realizing peace by addressing 
all final status issues, namely Jerusalem, refugees, 
settlements, borders, water, security and the release of 
all prisoners and detainees. This must be done in a 
manner that will achieve freedom, independence and 
justice for the Palestinian people in their homeland, 
rectify the historical injustice inflicted upon them, 
achieve security and safety for all their neighbours, 
lead to a just peace throughout the Middle East, 
including on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and thus 
usher in a new era of stability, progress, prosperity, 
coexistence and good-neighbourliness. 
 The political process will be put back on the right 
track only if the international community assumes the 
main responsibility for ending the Israeli occupation, 
the longest occupation in modern history; ensures our 
people’s right to self-determination in their 
independent sovereign State based on the borders of 
4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital; and 
finds a just and agreed solution to the plight of the 
Palestinian refugees. This must all be carried out 
through the implementation of the principles of the 
Charter, the relevant Security Council and General 
Assembly resolutions, the advisory opinion of the 
International Court of Justice, and the provisions of 
international law, including international humanitarian 
and human rights law, on the ground in the occupied 
  
 
10-55103 32 
 
Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. All of 
these measures constitute the legitimate political terms 
of reference for any successful negotiation leading to a 
final peace settlement. 
 Our people, despite the profound and continued 
suffering they have endured, hold steadfast to their 
rights, their land and their national soil. At the same 
time, they are determined to restore national unity and 
the bonds between the two parts of our homeland. We 
are making every effort to restore unity through 
dialogue and the good, honourable efforts of our 
brothers and friends, especially the Arab Republic of 
Egypt. On our part, we will spare no effort to end the 
division resulting from the coup against Palestinian 
legitimacy and to establish democracy as an essential 
foundation of our body politic. 
 We will also assume our responsibility for 
building national institutions for our independent State 
and national economy, and for ensuring the security 
and safety of our citizens under a national authority 
based on the rule of law, accountability, transparency 
and justice. We will also continue to fulfil our 
obligations under the road map and the agreements 
reached between the two sides. 
 In conclusion, it is imperative in this context to 
express our appreciation to all those who have 
contributed to sponsoring and supporting the peace 
process. Here, I would like to express my special 
thanks to His Excellency Mr. Barack Obama, President 
of the United States of America, who affirmed in his 
statement before the Assembly (see ) two 
days ago the two-State solution and the need to freeze 
settlement activities and establish the independent 
State of Palestine with full membership in the United 
Nations next year. On this occasion, we reaffirm our 
readiness to cooperate fully with his country’s efforts 
for a successful political process to achieve a 
comprehensive and just peace in the region. 
 We must also pay tribute to the United Nations 
for preserving our cause and extending a helping hand 
to our people through its resolutions and decisions, 
which constitute an unshakeable foundation for peace. 
From this rostrum, we call on the United Nations to 
continue its pivotal role until justice is upheld, our 
people have regained their usurped rights and peace 
prevails in our entire region. We reiterate our 
appreciation for the Organization’s tireless efforts to 
stand in solidarity with the just cause of Palestine, and 
we reaffirm our faith in the peace to which we and all 
the peoples in the region aspire. We ask God to bless us 
with a future in which we will all enjoy peace, security 
and stability."
1,2009,"PSE","I 
congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly. I wish you every 
success in your noble mission and recognize your long 
experience in international political affairs. I also 
extend our greetings and thanks to former President, 
His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, 
whose positions and active efforts reflected the spirit 
and principles of this international organization, which 
is headed by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon, whom I also salute. I express our 
appreciation for everything he has done personally and 
through the organs and agencies of the United Nations, 
notably the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), to 
assist the Palestinian people and defend their rights.  
 During this session we have a full agenda before 
us. The peoples of the whole world are looking to this 
body to determine what can be done to save our planet 
from the effects of climate change and global warming 
and to address the world financial crisis. Many 
countries, including small and developing countries, 
see the need to reform the United Nations, including 
the Security Council, so as to reflect the reality of the 
current international situation and to ensure more 
comprehensive representation of the international 
community.  
 These common concerns must not overshadow 
the fact that serious problems face the Middle East 
region in particular, first and foremost the lack of 
commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and 
the extent to which the resolutions of the General 
Assembly and the Security Council are actually being 
implemented without the application of double 
standards. Everyone agrees on the need to achieve 
peace in the Middle East, to counter extremism and 
violence, and to establish the region as a zone free of 
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction. Yet the larger wound and deeper tragedy 
remains the suffering of our Palestinian people since 
the Nakba — the catastrophe — more than 60 years 
ago, to which the United Nations is a living witness. Its 
archives contain not dozens but hundreds of resolutions 
that have not been implemented. 
 The suffering of the Palestinian people as a result 
of Israel’s settler occupation is crystal clear to the 
world. Since the occupation of the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem, in 1967, Israel 
has continued with its settlement policy on all 
Palestinian land, especially in holy Jerusalem, where 
that policy is being accelerated and escalated by many 
means, including the seizure of the homes of 
Palestinians in the city, the imposition of restrictions, 
even preventing Palestinians from building and 
sometimes from repairing their homes while new 
settlement neighbourhoods are established. Jerusalem 
is becoming completely isolated from its surroundings 
because of the illegal settlements and the apartheid 
wall. 
 We now face a unique situation. If international 
law stipulates the inadmissibility of the acquisition of 
the territory of others by force, how can we then deal 
with the current situation where Israeli settlement 
policies are undermining the goal of establishing a 
geographically contiguous Palestinian State in 
implementation of the will of the international 
consensus? That consensus is reflected in the many 
resolutions and principles, including the Road Map, 
which we all agreed upon and which is based on the 
 
 
31 09-52463 
 
principle of land for peace and on an end to the 
occupation that began in 1967. 
 Immense efforts have been exerted and many 
conferences have been held over the years, particularly 
since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Yet all 
of this has not led to an end to the conflict. President 
Barack Obama gave much hope to our people and the 
peoples of the region when he announced his vision for 
a peace agreement on the basis of a two-State solution 
and the cessation of all settlement activities. We 
welcomed the active American diplomacy to revive the 
peace process and all efforts of the international 
Quartet and its members: the United Nations, the 
European Union, the Russian Federation and the 
United States.  
 All these active efforts and initiatives, which 
have been welcomed and supported by us and by the 
Arab States, are however confronted by the 
intransigence of Israel, which refuses to adhere to the 
requirements for relaunching the peace process. How is 
it conceivable that negotiations can be held on the 
borders and on Jerusalem while Israeli bulldozers are 
working to change the reality on the ground with the 
aim of creating a new reality and imposing the borders 
that Israel desires? How can one conceive of holding 
negotiations without agreement on the terms of 
reference and the objective of those negotiations, 
which the whole world has unanimously agreed upon, 
namely ending the Israeli occupation of the territories 
occupied in 1967, establishing the State of Palestine, 
with Jerusalem as its capital, reaching a just and agreed 
upon solution to the question of Palestinian refugees on 
the basis of resolution 194 (III) of 1948, and achieving 
peace on all the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks, as affirmed in the Arab Peace Initiative, which 
provides a precious opportunity that must be seized to 
achieve peace? 
 In this regard, I should like to express our deep 
appreciation of the important speech delivered to the 
Assembly by President Obama two days ago (see 
), in which he affirmed the necessity of 
ending the occupation that began in 1967 and the 
illegitimacy of the settlements. He also stressed the 
need to establish an independent, sovereign and viable 
Palestinian State and to address all the final-status 
issues in the negotiations, foremost among these 
Jerusalem, refugees, borders, water and settlements, 
along with others. We reiterate that adherence to these 
principles, in addition to a complete freeze on all 
settlement activities, can salvage the peace process and 
open horizons for its success. 
 I reaffirm the eagerness of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization to achieve a just, lasting and 
comprehensive peace in accordance with the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. At the same 
time, I caution that the settlement policy and the 
building of the separation wall, which continue to be 
pursued by the Israeli occupation, will abort 
opportunities to relaunch the peace process. Time is 
running out and the risks are becoming greater as a 
result of the continued suffering of the Palestinian 
people under the last remaining occupation in the 
world.  
 We call upon the international community to 
uphold international law and international legitimacy 
and to exert pressure on Israel to cease its settlement 
activities, to comply with the agreements it has signed, 
to cease its policies of occupation and colonial 
settlement, to release the approximately 11,000 
prisoners and detainees and to lift the unjust siege 
imposed on the Gaza Strip, which was subjected 
months ago to devastating aggression claiming 
thousands of civilian casualties among and causing 
unprecedented destruction of infrastructure and public 
facilities, including hospitals, mosques, schools and 
even United Nations facilities. 
 Our people, which continues to demand its rights 
and to be determined to remain in its homeland despite 
all of the suffering caused by the detentions, the 
blockade and the killings, is also keen to end internal 
division and to restore national unity. Our sister, Egypt, 
is making commendable efforts to achieve that goal.  
 In spite of all our suffering from the occupation 
and its practices, we continue to work to build and 
develop our national institutions. We have made 
significant progress in this regard both in upholding the 
rule of law and public order and in promoting 
economic and social development, despite the harsh 
conditions of the occupation and the blockade. We 
continue to make every possible effort for the success 
of the efforts of our brothers in Egypt to end the 
ongoing coup in the Gaza Strip and to restore our 
national unity by resorting to the ballot box and 
holding presidential and legislative elections on their 
constitutional date under the supervision and control of 
Arab and Islamic countries, the United Nations and the 
  
 
09-52463 32 
 
international community. In that way, democracy will 
be firmly institutionalized in our political life. 
 Hope will remain alive in our souls and we will 
not despair of regaining our rights on the basis of 
relevant resolutions of the United Nations, the historic 
role of which we reaffirm for attaining peace and 
upholding the principle of “might for right” and not 
“right for might”.  
 From this rostrum, I conclude by reaffirming our 
commitment to the Road Map, the Arab Peace 
Initiative and to all terms of reference of the political 
process. We call upon all parties to respect and abide 
by them to provide the opportunity to launch a 
successful and effective peace process. We are 
confident that all our brothers in sisterly Arab countries 
will adhere to the Arab Peace Initiative as a basis for 
safeguarding our rights and opening the way towards 
genuine peaceful relations with Israel once the 
occupation is ended and the independent State of 
Palestine is established."
1,2011,"PSE","At the 
outset, I extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on your 
assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly 
for this session. I wish you every success. 
 Today, on behalf of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian people, I 
extend my sincere congratulations to the Government 
and the people of South Sudan on their deserved 
admission as a full Member of the United Nations. We 
wish them progress and prosperity. 
 I also congratulate the Secretary-General, 
Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his election for a new term at the 
helm of the United Nations. This renewal of trust 
reflects the world’s appreciation for his efforts, which 
have strengthened the role of the Organization. 
 The question of Palestine is intricately linked 
with the United Nations through the resolutions 
adopted by its various organs and agencies and through 
the essential and lauded role of the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the 
Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA embodies the 
international responsibility with regard to the plight of 
Palestine’s refugees, who are the victims of Al-Nakba, 
the catastrophe that occurred in 1948.  
 We aspire to and seek a greater and more 
effective role for the United Nations in working to 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace in our region, 
one that ensures the inalienable, legitimate national 
rights of the Palestinian people as defined by the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and as embodied 
by the United Nations. 
 A year ago, on this same occasion and in this 
same Hall, many leaders and heads of delegations 
addressed the stalled peace efforts in our region. 
Everyone had high hopes for a new round of final 
status negotiations, which had begun in early 
September in Washington under the direct auspices of 
President Obama and with participation of the Quartet, 
Egypt and Jordan, to reach a peace agreement within 
one year. We entered those negotiations with open 
hearts and attentive ears and sincere intentions. We 
were ready with our documents, files, papers and 
proposals. But the negotiations broke down just weeks 
after they were launched. 
 After that, we did not give up and did not cease 
our efforts to craft initiatives and make contacts. Over 
the past year, we did not leave a door to be knocked on 
or a channel to be tested or a path to be taken. We did 
not ignore any formal or informal party of influence 
and stature that could be addressed. We considered 
positively the various ideas and proposals and 
initiatives presented by many countries and parties. But 
all of those sincere efforts and endeavours by 
international parties were repeatedly smashed against 
the rocks of the positions of the Israeli Government, 
which quickly dashed the hopes raised by the launch of 
negotiations last September. 
 The core issue here is that the Israeli Government 
refuses to commit to terms of reference for the 
negotiations that are based on international law and 
United Nations resolutions, and that it frantically 
continues to intensify the building of settlements on the 
territory of the future State of Palestine. 
 Settlement activities embody the core of the 
policy of colonial military occupation of the land of the 
Palestinian people and all of the brutality, aggression 
and racial discrimination against our people that that 
policy entails. The policy constitutes a breach of 
international humanitarian law and United Nations 
  
 
11-51185 26 
 
resolutions. It is the primary cause of the failure of the 
peace process, the collapse of dozens of opportunities 
and the burial of the great hopes that arose from the 
signing of the Declaration of Principles in 1993 
between the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
Israel to achieve a just peace that would begin a new 
era for our region. 
 Reports by United Nations missions and by 
several Israeli civil institutions and societies convey a 
horrific picture of the size of the settlement campaign, 
which the Israeli Government does not hesitate to boast 
about and which it continues to execute through the 
systematic confiscation of Palestinian lands. It invites 
tenders for the construction of thousands of new 
settlement units in various areas of the West Bank, 
particularly in the Arab parts of Jerusalem. It 
accelerates construction of the apartheid separation 
Wall that is eating up large tracts of our land, dividing 
it into separate and isolated islands, destroying family 
life and communities and harming the livelihoods of 
tens of thousands of Palestinian families.  
 The occupying Power also continues to refuse to 
issue permits for our people to build in occupied East 
Jerusalem. At the same time, it intensifies its decades-
long campaign of demolition and confiscation of 
homes, displacing Palestinian owners and residents 
under a multipronged policy of ethnic cleansing aimed 
at pushing Palestinians away from their ancestral 
homeland. Moreover, matters have reached the point 
where orders have been issued to deport elected 
representatives from their city of Jerusalem.  
 The occupying Power also continues to undertake 
excavations that threaten our Holy Places, and its 
military checkpoints prevent our citizens from gaining 
access to their mosques and churches. It continues to 
besiege the Holy City with a ring of settlements and a 
separation Wall imposed to separate the Holy City from 
the rest of the cities of Palestine. The occupation is 
racing against time to redraw the borders on our land 
according to what it wants and to impose a fait 
accompli on the ground that changes its realities and 
features and that is undermining the realistic potential 
for the establishment of the State of Palestine. 
 At the same time, the occupying Power continues 
to impose its strict blockade on the Gaza Strip and to 
target Palestinian civilians by assassinations, air strikes 
and artillery shelling. It persists with its war of 
aggression of three years ago on Gaza, which resulted 
then in the massive destruction of homes, schools, 
hospitals and mosques and thousands of martyrs and 
wounded. The occupying Power also continues its 
incursions into areas of the Palestinian National 
Authority through raids, arrests and killings at the 
checkpoints.  
 In recent years, the criminal actions of armed 
settler militias, who enjoy the special protection of the 
occupation army, have intensified. They have 
perpetrated frequent attacks against our people, 
targeting their homes, schools, universities, mosques, 
fields, crops and trees. Today they killed one 
Palestinian who was protesting peacefully. Despite our 
repeated warnings, the Israeli authorities have not 
acted to curb those attacks, and we hold them fully 
responsible for the crimes of the settlers. 
 Those are just a few examples of the policy of the 
Israeli settlement occupation. That policy is 
responsible for the repeated failure of the successive 
international attempts to salvage the peace process. 
The policy will destroy the chances of achieving a two-
State solution, upon which there is an international 
consensus. Here I caution, and I caution aloud, that the 
settlement policy threatens also to undermine the 
structure of the Palestinian National Authority and 
even to end its existence. 
 In addition, we now face new conditions not 
previously imposed, conditions that will transform the 
raging conflict in our inflamed region into a religious 
conflict, one that will be a threat to the future of a 
million and a half Palestinians who are citizens of 
Israel. We reject that eventuality; it is impossible for us 
to accept being dragged into it. 
 All of those unilateral Israeli actions in our 
country are aimed at perpetuating the occupation. 
Israel has re-established the civil and military authority 
in the West Bank by a unilateral action, and its military 
authorities determine whether or not a Palestinian 
citizen has the right to reside in any part of the 
Palestinian territory. Israel is the entity that decides to 
confiscate our land and our water and to obstruct our 
movement and the movement of goods, and indeed our 
whole destiny. All of that is unilateral. Yet Israel 
complains of unilateralism — despite our agreements 
with it, which forbid unilateral individual actions.  
 In 1974, our leader the late Yasser Arafat came to 
this Hall and assured the members of the General 
Assembly of our affirmative pursuit for peace, urging 
 
 
27 11-51185 
 
the United Nations to realize the inalienable national 
rights of the Palestinian people, stating: “Do not let the 
olive branch fall from my hand.” (A/PV.2282, para. 82)  
 In 1988, President Arafat again addressed the 
General Assembly, which convened in Geneva to hear 
him. There he submitted the Palestinian peace 
programme adopted by the Palestine National Council 
at its session held that year in Algeria. When we 
adopted that programme, we were taking a painful and 
very difficult step for all of us, especially those of us, 
including myself, who during the 1948 Al-Nakba were 
forced to leave their homes and their towns and 
villages, carrying only some of our belongings — 
along with our grief and our memories and the keys to 
our homes — to camps of exile and diaspora. That 
catastrophic exodus was one of the worst operations of 
uprooting, destruction and removal of a vibrant and 
cohesive society that had been contributing in a 
pioneering and leading way to the cultural, educational 
and economic renaissance of the Arab Middle East. 
 Still, because we believe in peace, because of our 
commitment to international legitimacy and because 
we had the courage to make difficult decisions for our 
people, and in the absence of absolute justice, we 
decided to adopt the path of relative justice, justice that 
is possible and could correct part of the grave historical 
injustice committed against our people. Thus, we 
agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22 per 
cent of the territory of historical Palestine — on all the 
Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967. By 
taking that historic step, which was welcomed by the 
States of the world, we made a major concession in 
order to achieve a historic compromise that would 
allow peace to be made in the land of peace. 
 In the years that followed, from the Madrid 
Conference and the Washington negotiations leading to 
the Oslo agreement, which we signed 18 years ago in 
the White House garden and which was linked with the 
letters of mutual recognition — mutual recognition — 
between the PLO and Israel, we persevered and dealt 
positively and responsibly with all efforts aimed at the 
achievement of a lasting peace agreement. Yet, as we 
said earlier, every initiative, every conference, every 
new round of negotiations and every movement was 
shattered on the rock of the Israeli settlement 
expansion project. 
 On behalf of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization — the sole legitimate representative of 
the Palestinian people, which will remain so until the 
end of the conflict in all its aspects and until the 
resolution of all final status issues — I affirm the 
following points.  
 The goal of the Palestinian people is the 
realization of their inalienable national rights and of 
their independent State of Palestine, with East 
Jerusalem as its capital, on all the land of the West 
Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, 
which Israel occupied in the June 1967 war. This goal 
must be realized in conformity with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and with the achievement of a 
just and agreed-upon solution to the Palestine refugee 
issue in accordance with General Assembly resolution 
194 (III), as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. 
That Initiative presented the consensus Arab and 
Islamic vision to resolve the core of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and to achieve the just and comprehensive 
peace to which we are committed and are working 
towards.  
 We are committed to this. Achieving this much-
desired peace also requires the release of political 
prisoners, prisoners of freedom and Palestinian 
detainees in Israeli prisons without delay. 
 Secondly, the PLO and the Palestinian people are 
committed to renouncing violence and reject and 
condemn terrorism in all its forms, especially State 
terrorism, including terrorism by settlers. We also 
adhere to all agreements signed between the PLO and 
Israel. 
 Thirdly, we are committed to the option of 
negotiating a lasting solution to the conflict in 
accordance with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. I affirm here that the Palestine Liberation 
Organization is ready to return immediately to the 
negotiating table on the basis of the adopted terms of 
reference and consistent with international legitimacy 
and a complete cessation of settlement activities. 
 Fourthly, our people will continue their popular 
peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation, its 
settlement and apartheid policies, and its construction 
of the racist separation Wall, and they receive support 
for their resistance that is consistent with international 
humanitarian law and international conventions. They 
have the support of peace activists from Israel and 
around the world, reflecting an impressive, inspiring 
and courageous example of the strength of this 
defenceless people, armed only with their dreams, 
  
 
11-51185 28 
 
courage, hope and slogans in the face of bullets, tanks, 
tear gas and bulldozers. 
 Fifthly, when we bring our plight and our case to 
this international forum, it is a confirmation of our 
reliance on the political and diplomatic option and is a 
confirmation of the fact that we do not undertake 
unilateral steps. Our efforts and moves are not aimed at 
isolating Israel or at delegitimizing it; rather, we want 
to gain legitimacy for the cause of the people of 
Palestine. We aim to delegitimize only the settlement 
activities, the occupation and apartheid and the logic of 
ruthless force, and we believe that all the countries of 
the world stand with us in this regard. 
 I am here to say on behalf of the Palestinian 
people and the Palestine Liberation Organization that 
we extend our hand to the Israeli Government and the 
Israeli people for peacemaking. I say to them: let us 
urgently build together a future for our children where 
they can enjoy freedom, security and prosperity. Let us 
build bridges of dialogue instead of checkpoints and 
walls of separation. Let us build cooperative relations 
based on parity, equity and friendship between two 
neighbouring States — Palestine and Israel — instead 
of policies based on occupation, settlement, war and 
elimination of the other. 
 Despite the unquestionable right of our people to 
self-determination and to the establishment of an 
independent State, as stipulated in international 
resolutions, we have accepted over the past few years 
to engage in what appeared to be a test of our 
worthiness, entitlement and eligibility. During the past 
two years, our national Authority has implemented a 
programme to build our State institutions. Despite the 
extraordinary situation and the obstacles imposed on us 
by Israel, a serious and extensive project was launched 
that has included the implementation of plans to 
enhance and advance the judiciary and the apparatus 
for the maintenance of order and security; the 
development of administrative, financial and oversight 
systems; the upgrading of the performance of 
institutions; and enhancing self-reliance to reduce the 
need for foreign aid.  
 With the support of brotherly Arab countries and 
donors from friendly countries, for which we are 
thankful, a number of large infrastructure projects have 
been implemented, focused on various aspects of 
services, with special attention to rural and 
marginalized areas. In the midst of this massive 
national project, we have been strengthening what we 
wish to be the features of our future State: the 
preservation of security for citizens and public order; 
the promotion of judicial authority and the rule of law; 
strengthening the role of women via legislation, laws 
and participation; ensuring the protection of public 
freedoms and strengthening the role of civil society 
institutions; and institutionalizing rules and regulations 
for ensuring accountability and transparency in the 
work of our ministries and departments; to entrenching 
the pillars of democracy as the basis of Palestinian 
political life. 
 When division struck the unity of our homeland, 
our people and our institutions, we were determined to 
adopt dialogue as a path to the restoration of our unity. 
We succeeded months ago in achieving national 
reconciliation, and we hope that its implementation 
will be accelerated in the coming weeks. The core 
pillar of this reconciliation involved turning to the 
people through legislative and presidential elections, to 
be conducted within a year, because the State we want 
is one characterized by the rule of law, the exercise of 
democracy, the protection of the freedoms and equality 
of all citizens without any discrimination, and the 
transfer of power through the ballot box. 
 We believe that the reports issued recently by the 
United Nations, the World Bank, the Ad Hoc Liaison 
Committee for the Coordination of International 
Assistance to Palestinians (AHLC) and the 
International Monetary Fund have confirmed and 
lauded what has been accomplished, and have 
considered it an exceptional and unprecedented model. 
The consensus conclusion of the AHLC a few days ago 
here, in this very city, described what has been 
accomplished as a remarkable international success 
story and confirmed the full readiness of the 
Palestinian people and their institutions for the 
immediate independence of the State of Palestine. That 
was a testimonial from the international community.  
 I do not believe that anyone with even a shred of 
conscience could reject our application for full 
membership in the United Nations and our admission 
as an independent State. 
 It is no longer possible to redress the issue of the 
blocked horizon of the peace talks with the same 
means and methods that have been repeatedly tried and 
have proved unsuccessful in past years.

 The crisis is far too deep to be neglected; it is far 
more dangerous and critical to simply be circumvented 
or to postpone its inevitable explosion. It is neither 
possible, nor practical nor acceptable to return to 
conducting business as usual, as if everything were 
fine. It is futile to go into negotiations without clear 
parameters, terms of reference, credibility or a specific 
timetable. Negotiations will be meaningless as long as 
the occupation army on the ground continues to 
entrench its occupation instead of rolling it back, and 
to change the demography of our country in order to 
create a new basis on which to alter the borders. That is 
totally unacceptable. 
 This is the moment of truth. Our people are 
waiting to hear the world’s answer. Will it allow Israel 
to continue the last occupation in the world? We are the 
last people to remain under occupation. Will the world 
allow Israel to occupy us forever and to remain a State 
above the law and accountability? Will it allow Israel 
to continue rejecting the resolutions of the Security 
Council and the General Assembly and the 
International Court of Justice and the positions of the 
overwhelming majority of countries in the world? Is 
this acceptable? 
 The heart of the crisis in our region is very simple 
and clear. There are those who believe that we are an 
unnecessary people in the Middle East and those who 
believe that there is in fact a missing State that needs to 
be established immediately. I come before the General 
Assembly today from the Holy Land, the land of 
Palestine, the land of divine messages, ascension of the 
Prophet Muhammad and the birthplace of Jesus Christ, 
to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people, in the 
homeland and in the diaspora, and to say, after 63 years 
of suffering the ongoing Al-Nakba: enough, enough, 
enough.  
 It is time for the Palestinian people to gain their 
freedom and independence. The time has come to end 
the suffering and the plight of millions of Palestinian 
refugees in the homeland and the diaspora, some of 
whom have been forced to seek refuge more than once 
in different places of the world, to end their 
displacement, and to realize their rights. 
 At a time when the Arab peoples affirm their 
quest for democracy — in what is now called the Arab 
Spring — the time has also come for the Palestinian 
Spring, the time for independence. The time has come 
for our men, women and children to live normal lives; 
for them to be able to sleep without waiting for the 
worst that the next day might bring; for mothers to be 
assured that their children will return home without 
fear of being killed, arrested or humiliated; for students 
to be able to go to their schools and universities 
without checkpoints obstructing them.  
 The time has come for sick people to be able to 
reach hospitals normally, and for our farmers to be able 
to tend their rich soil without fear that the occupier will 
seize their land and water, which the separation wall 
prevents access to, and without fear of the settlers with 
their guard dogs who attack Palestinians. They build 
their settlements on our lands and uproot and burn 
olive trees that have existed in Palestine for hundreds 
of years. The time has come for the thousands of 
prisoners of conscience and freedom to be released 
from prisons and return to their families and their 
children and become a part of building their homeland, 
for the freedom of which they have sacrificed so much. 
 My people want to exercise their right to enjoy a 
normal life like the rest of humankind. They believe in 
what our great poet Mahmoud Darwish said: “Standing 
here, staying here, permanent here, eternal here, and 
we have one goal, one goal, one goal - to be. And we 
shall be.” 
 We profoundly appreciate and value the positions 
of all the States that have supported our struggle and 
our rights and recognized the State of Palestine 
following the Declaration of Independence in 1988, as 
well as those that have recently recognized the State of 
Palestine and upgraded the level of Palestine’s 
representation in their capitals. I also salute Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon, who spoke the truth a few days 
ago when he said that the Palestinian State should have 
been established years ago. 
 The General Assembly may rest assured that such 
support for our people is more valuable to them than 
anyone can imagine, for it makes them feel that 
someone is listening to their narrative and that their 
tragedy, the horrors of Al-Nakba and the occupation, 
under which they have suffered terribly, are not being 
ignored. It reinforces their hope and belief that justice 
is possible in this world. The loss of hope is the most 
ferocious enemy of peace, and despair is the strongest 
ally of extremism. 
 The time has come for my courageous and proud 
people, after decades of displacement, colonial 
occupation and ceaseless suffering, to live like other 
  
 
11-51185 30 
 
peoples of the Earth, free in a sovereign and 
independent homeland. 
 Mr. President, I would like to inform you that, 
before delivering this statement, I, in my capacity as 
President of the State of Palestine and Chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, submitted to Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon an application for the admission of Palestine 
as a full Member of the United Nations on the basis of 
the 4 June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its 
capital. 
 I hold in my hands a copy of the application. I 
call upon the Secretary-General to expedite transmittal 
of our request to the Security Council, and I call upon 
the members of the Council to vote in favour of our 
full membership. I also appeal to the States that have 
not yet done so to recognize the State of Palestine. 
 The support of the countries of the world for our 
endeavour is a victory for rights, freedom, justice, law 
and international legitimacy. It will provide 
tremendous support for the peace option and enhance 
the negotiations’ chances of success. The Assembly’s 
assistance and support for the establishment of the 
State of Palestine and for its admission to the United 
Nations as a full Member State are the greatest 
contribution to peacemaking in the land of peace, and 
throughout the world. 
 I have come here today carrying a message from 
a courageous and proud people. Palestine is 
experiencing its rebirth. That is my message. May all 
the people of the world stand with the people of 
Palestine now as they march steadfastly to meet their 
appointment with history, freedom and independence. 
And I hope that we will not have long to wait."
1,2012,"PSE","I wish to
begin by extending my appreciation to the heads of all
the delegations who in their statements to the Assembly
stressed the urgency of progress towards the realization
of a just peace in our region, one which would allow the
Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable national
rights.
Developments over the past year have confirmed
what we have persistently drawn attention to and warned of: the catastrophic danger of racist settlers moving into
our country. During the past months, attacks by terrorist
militias of Israeli settlers have become a daily reality,
with at least 535 attacks since the beginning of the year.
We are facing relentless waves of attacks against our
people, our mosques, our churches and monasteries,
and our homes and schools. They are unleashing their
venom against our trees, fields, crops and properties,
and our people have become fixed targets for acts of
killing and torture, with the complete collusion of the
occupying forces and the Israeli Government.
The escalation of settler attacks should not
surprise anyone, for it is the inherent byproduct of
the continuation of the occupation and a Government
policy that deliberately fosters the settlements and
settlers and deems their satisfaction to be an absolute
priority. And it is the inherent byproduct of the racist
climate fuelled by a culture of incitement in Israeli
curriculums and extremist declarations and fatwas,
which are rife with hatred and are rooted in a series
of discriminatory laws created and enacted over the
years against the Palestinian people by the Israeli
security apparatus and courts. Those entities provide
excuse after excuse for the settlers’ crimes and for
their accelerated release should one of them happen
to be arrested. Official and military commissions of
inquiry fabricate justifications for soldiers who have
committed what are clearly considered war crimes and
have perpetrated acts of murder, torture and abuse of
peaceful Palestinian civilians.
Over the past year, since the convening of the
General Assembly’s previous session, the occupying
Power has persisted with its settlement campaign,
focusing on Jerusalem and its environs. It is a campaign
clearly and deliberately aimed at altering the city’s
historic character and the glorious image of the Holy
City as etched in the minds of humankind. It is a
campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinian
people of Jerusalem via the demolition of their homes
and prevention of their reconstruction, the revocation
of residency rights, the denial of basic services,
especially with regard to the construction of schools,
the closure of institutions and the impoverishment of
Jerusalem’s community via a siege behind walls and
checkpoints. That chokes the City and prevents millions
of Palestinians from freely accessing its mosques,
churches, schools, hospitals and markets.
The occupying Power has also continued its
construction and expansion of settlements in different areas throughout the West Bank and has continued
its suffocating blockade, as well as raids and attacks
against our people in the Gaza Strip, who to this day
suffer from the disastrous impact of the destructive war
of aggression committed against them a few years ago.
Nearly 5,000 Palestinians remain captive as prisoners
and detainees of conscious in Israel’s jails. In that
regard, we call upon the international community to
compel the Government of Israel to respect the Geneva
Conventions of 1949 and to investigate the conditions
of detention of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and
we stress the need for their release. They are soldiers in
their people’s struggle for freedom, independence and
peace.
At the same time, the occupying Power continues
to tighten the siege and impose severe restrictions on
movement, preventing the Palestinian Authority from
implementing vital infrastructure projects and providing
services to its citizens, who are also being prevented
from cultivating their land and deprived of water for
irrigation. The occupying Power is also obstructing the
establishment of agricultural, industrial, tourism and
housing projects by the Palestinian private sector in
vast areas of the occupied Palestinian territory, which
are classified as areas subject to the absolute control of
the occupation, areas that encompasses approximately
60 per cent of the West Bank.
The occupying Power continues to deliberately
demolish what the Palestinian Authority is
building — projects funded by donor brethren and
friends — and is destroying the Authority’s building
projects involving roads, simple homes for its citizens
and agricultural facilities. In fact, over the past 12
months, the Israeli occupying forces demolished 510
Palestinian structures in those areas and displaced 770
Palestinians from their homes. Those measures have
caused great damage to our economy and impeded our
development programmes and private-sector activity.
They compound the socioeconomic difficulties of
our people under occupation, a fact confirmed by
international financial institutions. Israel’s overall
policy is ultimately leading to the weakening of the
Palestinian Authority, undermining its ability to
carry out its functions and projects and to implement
its obligations. This threatens to undermine its very
existence or cause its collapse.
All of that is taking place in the context of an Israeli
political discourse that does not hesitate to brandish
aggressive, extremist positions. In many aspects and in their practical application on the ground, they incite
religious conflict. That is something we firmly reject,
based on our principles and convictions and due to our
understanding of what it means to fuel such fires in this
sensitive area, which is full of explosive f lashpoints,
and how that can fuel the action of extremists from
various quarters, especially those trying to use tolerant,
monotheistic religions as an ideological justification
for their terrorism.
For our part, as proof of our seriousness and our
sincere intention to create an opening in this impasse,
we conducted exploratory talks with the Israeli
Government at the beginning of the year, at the initiative
of the brotherly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. We
have also encouraged the expressed desires of several
countries to contribute to efforts to break the cycle of
deadlock and have ourselves undertaken initiatives
to create favourable conditions for the resumption of
negotiations. Unfortunately, however, the result of all
those initiatives has been very negative.
There can be only one reading of the Israeli
Government’s actions and practices in our homeland
and of the positions it has presented to us regarding the
substance of a final status agreement to end the conflict
and achieve peace: that the Israeli Government rejects
the two-State solution.
The two-State solution — namely, the State
of Palestine coexisting alongside the State of
Israel — represents the spirit and essence of the historic
compromise embodied in the Declaration of Principles,
which was agreed to in Oslo and was signed, 19 years
ago, by the Palestine Liberation Organization and the
Government of Israel under the auspices of the United
States of America and on the White House lawn. It is
a compromise by which, for the sake of making peace,
the Palestinian people accepted to establish their State
on only 22 per cent of the territory of historic Palestine.
Recent years have actually witnessed a systematic
acceleration and intensification of Israeli measures
aimed at gutting the Oslo Accords of their meaning,
while simultaneously building facts on the ground in
the occupied Palestinian territory that are making the
implementation of the Accords extremely difficult, if
not completely impossible.
The Israeli Government aims to continue its
occupation of East Jerusalem, to de facto annex large
areas of the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory
and to continue occupying a large portion of the territory under different designations. It refuses to
engage in any serious discussion of the issue of the
Palestinian refugees. It wants to continue its occupation
of Palestinian aquafers and its control over the most
fertile agricultural areas in our land, as well as over our
air, skies,water, borders and our life in its entirety.
The final map and borders that can be drawn in
accordance with Israel’s official positions reveal to us
small Palestinian enclaves surrounded by large Israeli
settlement blocs and walls and checkpoints, and vast
security zones and roads reserved for settlers. The
enclaves would therefore remain subject to the full
dominance of military and settler occupation, only
packaged under new names, such as the unilateral
plan for a so-called State with provisional borders. I
repeat — a State with provisional borders. That is a
project that we categorically reject from A to Z because
it will not bring about peace.
Israel refuses to end the occupation and refuses to
allow the Palestinian people to attain their freedom and
independence. It rejects the establishment of the State
of Palestine. Israel is promising the Palestinian people
a new catastrophe — a new Naqba — a new setback.
I speak on behalf of an angry people who feel
that while they demand their right to freedom, adopt a
culture of peace and adhere to the principles and rules
of international law and resolutions of international
legitimacy, rewards continue to be illogically bestowed
upon Israel, whose Government pursues a policy of
war, occupation and settler occupation. Israel continues
to be permitted to enjoy impunity, and some continue
to obstruct the adoption of a decisive position regarding
its violations of international law and covenants. That
represents a licence for the occupation to continue
its policy of dispossession and ethnic cleansing and
encourages it to entrench its system of apartheid against
the Palestinian people.
Despite our genuine feelings of anger, we — in
the name of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the
sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian
people — will not allow our country to be divided in
two.
We are the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people. I reaffirm without hesitation that
we are as committed — equally and by the same
measures — to peace and international legitimacy and
its covenants and resolutions as we are to upholding
our inalienable national rights and aspirations. And we reaffirm that we are committed to non-violence
and reject terrorism in all its forms, particularly State
terrorism.
Despite our disappointment, we continue to sincerely
extend a hand to the Israeli people to make peace. We
realize that ultimately the two peoples must live and
coexist, each in their respective State, in the Holy Land.
Furthermore, we realize that progress towards making
peace can be achieved through negotiations between
the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel.
Despite all the complexities of the prevailing
reality and all the frustrations that abound, we say
before the international community that there is still
a chance — maybe the last — to save the two-State
solution and to salvage peace. However, this urgent task
must be pursued via a new approach.
Whoever rushes to advise us to repeat an experience
that has proven to be futile, such as negotiations with
the Israeli Government without clear terms of reference,
must understand that this will result in the reproduction
of failure and again provide cover for consecrating the
occupation and will deal the final blow to an already
dying peace process. Whoever advises us to wait must
realize that the hotbeds of tension and the festering
situation in our country and our region have their own
timing and cannot withstand further procrastination
and delay, nor are they amenable to being relegated to
the bottom of the global agenda.
The approach required for salvaging the chance for
peace must, first and foremost, be predicated on the
understanding that the racist settler occupation must
be condemned, punished and boycotted so that it is
completely halted and eliminated. That approach also
requires a reaffirmation of, and adherence to, the terms
of reference and the foundations of the solution to the
conflict, which have been endorsed by all here.
We do not need to belabour the core components
of a just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Rather, what is needed is the will to implement those
components. Marathon negotiations are not required to
define them, rather it is the genuine and sincere intention
to reach peace that is needed. Those components are
by no means a mysterious puzzle or intractable riddle;
they are the clearest and best-known secrets in the
world. They include, in brief, the establishment of an
independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as
its capital, over the entire territory occupied by Israel
since 1967, and the realization of a just, agreed solution to the Palestine refugee issue, in accordance with
resolution 194 (III), as prescribed in the Arab Peace
Initiative.
The fundamental components of the solution to
the conflict exist in the documents and resolutions of
the United Nations. Member States already have them.
The components of the solution are also endorsed in
resolutions of regional organizations, beginning with
the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic
Cooperation, the Non-Aligned Movement and the
African Union. They can also be found in the statements
of the European Union and the international Quartet.
However, what is the use of all those terms of reference
if Israel continues to refuse, and is encouraged by
others to continue to oppose the terms of reference?
The international community, embodied in the
United Nations, is required now more than ever to uphold
its responsibilities. The Security Council is called upon
to urgently adopt a resolution comprising the pillars
and foundations for a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict that would serve as a binding term of reference
and guide for all if the vision of two States, Israel and
Palestine, is to survive and if peace is to prevail in the
land of peace — the birthplace of Jesus, peace be upon
him, the ascension of the Prophet Muhammad, peace
be upon him, and the final resting place of Abraham,
peace be upon him — Palestine, the land of the three
monotheistic religions.
All things considered, the establishment of a free
and independent State of Palestine is a sacred right of
the Palestinian people and an entitlement that must be
realized, for it has been overdue for too many decades.
It is not a grant to be bestowed upon us by anyone. It is
a right, and the Palestinian people are entitled to that
right.
At the same time, the Palestinian Authority has
affirmed, through the implementation of its State
institution-building programmes, the ability to create
an advanced model for an effective, modern State
through the development of the performance of its
institutions and public finance management and
through the adoption of standards for transparency,
strict accountability and rules of good governance.
Those achievements have been deemed by the Ad
Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of
the International Assistance to Palestinians, the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to
constitute an impressive undertaking and success story. Those achievements were again commended in the
latest report just a few days ago, which confirmed the
Palestinian Authority’s total readiness for the transition
to an independent State while at the same time stressing
that the Israeli occupation remained the only obstacle
to the realization of the State of Palestine.
During the previous session of the General
Assembly, we submitted our application for
consideration by the Security Council to allow the
State of Palestine to assume its rightful place among
the community of nations as a full Member of the
United Nations. A major and hostile uproar was raised
by some against that political, diplomatic, peaceful
step par excellence aimed at saving the peace process
by asserting its principles and foundation. Despite the
fact that the overwhelming majority of the countries
of the world supported, and continues to support, our
application, our endeavour was aborted. I do not see
even a single reason for opposing that request.
Yet when the countries of the world had the
opportunity to declare their stance without any
restrictions or veto during the previous autumn, they
voted, despite enormous pressure, in strong support of the
acceptance of Palestine as a member State of UNESCO.
A year has passed, and Palestine, the homeland of
Mahmoud Darwish and Edward Said, is playing its
role in UNESCO with a high level of responsibility and
professionalism. Palestine is committed to international
conventions and is cooperating with all member States
in order to advance the objectives of the organization
and providing a model of what its positive, constructive
contribution in international organizations would be.
In order to enhance the chances for peace, we will
continue our efforts to obtain full membership for
Palestine at the United Nations. For the same reason,
we have begun intensive consultations with various
regional organizations and Member States aimed at
the General Assembly’s adoption during this session
of a draft resolution considering the State of Palestine
as a non-member State of the United Nations. We are
confident that the vast majority of the countries of the
world support our efforts to bolster the chances for a
just peace. In our efforts we do not seek to delegitimize
an existing State, that is, Israel; but rather to establish
the State that must be realized, that is, Palestine. We
are not trying to delegitimize them; they are trying to
delegitimize us.
More than 64 years have passed since Al-Nakba
and a large number of those who were its immediate victims and witnessed its horrors have died. They died
with memories, preserved in their minds and hearts, of
their beautiful world that was devastated, their warm
homes that were demolished and their peaceful villages
that were erased from existence, and of the renaissance
that was undermined, and their loved ones, dear
men, women and children, who were killed in wars,
massacres, attacks, raids and incursions, and of their
beautiful country that was a beacon of coexistence,
tolerance, progress and a crossroads of civilization.
They died displaced and in refugee camps to which
they were expelled following their uprooting from their
homeland, as they awaited the moment in which they
would resume their suspended lives, complete their
interrupted journey and repair their shattered dreams.
They died while they clung to their legitimate human
right to justice, freedom and redress for the historically
unprecedented injustice inf licted upon them. Has the
time not come to undo that injustice?
At present, 77 per cent of the Palestinian people are
under the age of 35. Although they did not experience
the horrors of Al-Nakba, they know very well all its
horrendous details from the accounts of their parents
and grandparents who endured it. They continue to
suffer from its ongoing effects today and every day
as a result of the practices of the occupation and of
the settlers on a land that is diminishing in size. The
horizon before them is closed to their simple, ordinary
dreams. They see their homeland and their present and
future vulnerable to continued usurpation and they say
firmly: we shall not allow a new Al-Nakba to happen.
I say to the Assembly that the brave Palestinian
people will not allow themselves to be the victims
of a new Al-Nakba. We will not allow that. We will
stay on our land. My people will continue their epic
steadfastness and eternal survival journey in their
beloved land, every inch of which carries evidence and
landmarks affirming their roots and unique connection
to the land throughout ancient history. There is no
homeland for us except Palestine and there is no land
for us but Palestine. We shall not accept an alternative
homeland, nor an alternative land. Palestine is our
homeland and shall remain our homeland.
Our people will continue to build the institutions of
their State and strive to achieve national reconciliation
to restore the unity of our nation, people and institutions
via resorting to the ballot box, which will confirm our
people’s pluralistic democratic choice. Our people
are also determined to continue peaceful popular resistance, consistent with international humanitarian
law, against the occupation, against the settlements and
for the sake of freedom, independence and peace.
Let us prevent the occurrence of a new Al-Nakba
in the Holy Land. Let us support the realization of a
free, independent State of Palestine now. Let peace be
victorious before it is too late."
1,2008,"PSE","At the 
outset, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as 
President of the General Assembly for this session. We 
wish you every success and express our confidence that 
you will continue to pursue the great mission 
undertaken by the United Nations, which constitutes a 
monumental achievement in the history of humankind 
towards the promotion of dialogue and understanding 
and the resolution of issues and conflicts. That mission 
continues to be carried out in accordance with the rules 
and principles of international law, including 
humanitarian law, and on the basis of covenants that 
are consistent with the spirit of the times and the needs 
of the Organization in resolving problems and conflicts 
and confronting the enormous challenges before us, 
including poverty, hunger, the environment and climate 
change. 
 On this occasion, I also wish to commend the role 
and positive contributions of your predecessor, 
Mr. Srgjan Kerim, during the sixty-second session of 
the General Assembly. I would also like to express our 
deep appreciation for the efforts, positions and 
initiatives of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. They 
reflect his foresight and pragmatism regarding the 
various issues before us and in all regions that are 
suffering crises and that pose threats to world peace, 
including in particular in the Middle East region.

 I highly value the Secretary-General’s 
understanding of the need to address the political and 
humanitarian issues concerning the Palestinian people 
and our region, along with the important role that 
continues to be played by various United Nations 
agencies, including the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East 
(UNRWA), which continues to shoulder great burdens, 
especially in the Gaza Strip and in the refugee camps 
in the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. In the 
absence of such a continuous, outstanding role, we 
would have suffered even more severe and perilous 
crises than we have experienced to date. 
 This year, I should have liked to bear news of the 
achievement of a comprehensive agreement between us 
and our Israeli neighbours, bringing an end to the 
Israeli occupation of our land since 1967 and to the 
suffering of the millions of our people living as 
refugees and displaced persons in exile from their 
homeland. I believe that the entire world, with its 
differing alliances and trends, shares that desire with 
me, especially following the Annapolis conference late 
last year and the relaunching of the political process. 
That set the necessary guidelines for the advancement of 
negotiations towards the conclusion of a comprehensive 
and complete agreement on all final status issues. Such 
an agreement would lead to the realization of peace 
within our region and allow it to enter a qualitatively new 
era of relations characterized by good-neighbourliness, 
mutual recognition, security and open borders, and not 
by walls and barriers. 
 I am certain that never in the history of the 
conflict in our region have so many countries gathered 
as those that attended the Annapolis conference or 
participated in the consensus that arose there. Those 
who met not only demanded vigorous action to 
accelerate and advance negotiations towards the 
achievement of a final peace agreement, but also 
explicitly emphasized the need to remove all of the 
obstacles that have continuously impeded the 
negotiating process and cast doubt on its credibility, 
usefulness and ability to actually resolve all aspects of 
the conflict. The main obstacle I refer to is that of the 
Israeli settlement campaign and its continuation 
throughout the occupied Palestinian territory, 
particularly in East Jerusalem. 
 All of the participants in Annapolis took a united, 
firm and unprecedented stand calling for the immediate 
cessation of illegal settlement activities. It was 
recognized that this was a prerequisite for allowing the 
negotiations to resolve the conflict to lead to an end to 
the occupation and the grave, historical injustices 
inflicted on our people over the long decades. 
 The participation of most brotherly Arab 
countries in the Annapolis conference was not merely a 
symbolic gesture. On the contrary, their participation, 
in terms of both the level of attendance and the 
substance of positions, was a reflection of their 
genuine desire to embrace and support the political 
process and to address it in real earnest on the basis of 
the Arab peace initiative adopted at the Arab summit in 
Beirut in 2002. 
 Allow me, from this rostrum to recall once again 
the special importance of the Arab peace initiative. I do 
this personally in order to draw attention to the 
significance of each of its platforms, because it 
represents a major joint Arab undertaking and offers a 
historic opportunity for us to achieve peace, security 
and mutual recognition for all. 
 Indeed, it is strange to hear comments, which we 
do not understand or accept, that are used to justify the 
continuing settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of 
the occupied Palestinian territory and refer to the land 
as if it were not occupied territory or as if peace were 
possible without an end to the occupation of all of the 
Arab territories occupied since 1967, including the 
occupied Syrian Golan and the Lebanese Sheba’a 
Farms, and without an end to the occupation of East 
Jerusalem, the capital of our future Palestinian State 
and a city holy to hundreds of millions of the faithful 
of the monotheistic religions.  
 For the purpose of the noble and peaceful 
objectives of building of a new Middle East free of 
destructive mindsets and irrational tendencies that run 
counter to the highest human values preached by all 
religions and creeds — a new Middle East free of 
weapons of mass destruction — we have been and 
remain committed to international legitimacy. We 
extend our hands for dialogue and negotiation to 
resolve the conflict in a way that provides all that is 
required for coexistence and openness to the future so 
we can build our societies and nations in accordance 
with the aspirations of our peoples to progress and in 
the spirit of the times. 
 In that context, we express our full support for 
the continuation of the indirect talks currently taking 
place between Syria and Israel with the help of sisterly 
  
 
08-52272 38 
 
Turkey. We hope that the process will culminate in the 
achievement of justice, the implementation of 
international resolutions and the affirmation of 
international legitimacy. 
 For our part, we will continue to strive to achieve 
the maximum possible progress in the current 
negotiations between us and Israel through this year, 
benefiting from past experience and relying on the 
desire of all our peoples to realize a genuine and 
comprehensive peace that will end decades of 
occupation and hostilities and result in the attainment 
of the two-State solution — the State of Palestine 
living alongside the State of Israel on the basis of the 
1967 borders — and a just and agreed solution to the 
plight of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with 
resolution 194 (III). In referring to the benefits of past 
experience, I wish to convey clearly that partial or 
interim solutions or the dropping or deferral of those 
core issues are unacceptable and unviable and will 
maintain the roots of the conflict, thus undermining 
any achievement on the road to peace. The solution 
must be comprehensive, complete, detailed and 
wholehearted. 
 The solution we aspire to must include a 
mechanism to ensure its full and faithful 
implementation pursuant to the timetable agreed upon. 
All that inevitably requires international supervision of 
the implementation of the solution, as well as a more 
effective role for the international Quartet in 
safeguarding the solution we will reach and an 
effective guarantor role for the Security Council and 
various other United Nations bodies. 
 At this juncture, I would like to express our 
appreciation for the role played by the United States 
Administration, President George Bush and Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice in advancing the 
negotiations and the peace process, as well as their 
efforts to remove the obstacles that stand in its way. I 
also wish to commend the positions taken by the Arab, 
Islamic and non-aligned countries, which have always 
taken firm stances in support of a just peace. I would 
like to express our appreciation for the role played by 
the European Union, which has supported our efforts in 
every possible way, and the role and positions of the 
Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China 
and Japan, as well as of our friends and colleagues in 
Latin America and Africa who have always supported 
the advancement and continuity of the political 
process. 
 As humankind celebrates the sixtieth anniversary 
of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the conditions being endured by our people are 
increasingly severe and complex. Our nation, which 
possesses only a small area of land, continues to suffer 
the fragmentation and discontiguity of its cities and 
villages as a result of more than 600 checkpoints and 
roadblocks on all main and secondary roads. There is 
no precedent for that in modern history. The harshest 
and most painful of those barriers are those that have 
surrounded occupied East Jerusalem, severing the link 
between it and its Palestinian surroundings, not to 
mention changing the Islamic and Christian character 
of our city. 
 Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians 
have become daily occurrences. At the same time, 
ongoing tragedies strike every Palestinian family with 
the continuing detention and imprisonment of over 
11,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. I know of no 
situation in today’s world comparable to ours, where a 
people is subject to the detention of such large numbers 
of its civilians and where prisons continue to be filled 
with more and more accused who are guilty only of 
wanting to be free and of envisioning a future that is 
different from the reality of occupation, siege and the 
loss of hope. 
 Despite those harsh circumstances, our National 
Authority and governing institutions have exerted 
every possible effort to improve our conditions in all 
fields, including the security, economic, education, 
health and cultural sectors. 
 I wish to express our gratitude to our brothers in 
the Arab countries, to the General Secretariat of the 
League of Arab States, and to the whole international 
community for all the important assistance extended to 
our people and our Authority in all aspects of the 
endeavour to restore the Palestinian economy, provide 
real opportunities for its advancement, and rebuild the 
Palestinian security apparatus and the various 
institutions and agencies of the Palestinian Authority. 
 In that regard, I wish to convey special thanks 
and appreciation to all the envoys from other countries 
who have provided assistance in several fields, 
particularly Mr. Tony Blair, the Quartet Special Envoy. 
It is with pride that I can say that, even under those 
most difficult conditions we have been able to achieve 
security, the rule of law and public order for most of 
 
 
39 08-52272 
 
our towns and districts, despite all the remaining 
obstacles we have to confront. 
 However, we will continue to follow that same 
path with firm determination and resolve. In that 
connection, the Paris Donor’s Conference, followed by 
the Bethlehem economic conference, were two special 
occasions in support of our national economy, our 
financial and economic institutions and treasury, and 
assistance to the Palestinian private sector, which has 
unwaveringly borne heavy burdens over the past years 
and has not failed to develop and progress. 
 There is no doubt that the ongoing siege of the 
Gaza Strip, where unemployment is endemic, is 
compounding the tragic humanitarian crisis there. It is 
unprecedented in scope and scale, and the 
opportunities for education and medical care are 
scarce, punishing and causing the malnutrition of an 
entire generation with all the consequent risks for the 
future of the entire people. 
 All of that is in addition to the transformation of 
the Gaza Strip into a huge virtual prison holding nearly 
1.5 million Palestinians. We have exerted all efforts to 
get the siege on Gaza lifted, this dear part of our 
homeland. In that regard, we express our deep 
appreciation for the role played by the brotherly Arab 
countries, especially Egypt, to alleviate the suffering 
and to help us save our people from the extremely 
difficult situation they find themselves in, including in 
particular their efforts to end the division resulting 
from the bloody coup led by Hamas against Palestinian 
legitimacy more than a year ago. 
 As I have on more than one occasion, I would 
like to reaffirm once again from this rostrum that we 
will spare no effort to achieve Palestinian national 
reconciliation. We have already announced a 
preliminary plan that opens the door for this 
reconciliation to be realized and the formation of an 
independent, impartial Government that is acceptable 
to all, but that will not place us back under siege again. 
This Government will prepare for the holding of 
legislative and presidential elections. We will continue 
building a security apparatus based on professional 
tenets, with the support of Arab security. After the 
completion of those steps, it will be possible for us to 
proceed further towards strengthening our 
reconciliation and deepening the participation of all. If 
that is not actualized, whoever rejects those principles 
and does not conform with them must bear the 
responsibility before our entire people and before the 
Arab and international positions that reject this 
disintegration and division. 
 In concluding my statement, I recall the words of 
our great Palestinian poet, Mahmoud Darwish, whom 
we recently lost and whose loss was that of a great 
cultural and humanitarian symbol and icon. Mahmoud 
Darwish glorified life and cherished his homeland, 
calling on our new generations to love life on their land 
and to preserve its continuity and to keep the torch 
always lit. Mahmoud Darwish said,  
“On this land there is something that deserves 
life, on this land there was first the beginning and 
the end — a land called Palestine — a name that 
was and is and will endure”."
1,2015,"PSE","I come before the General Assembly today from Palestine to sound the alarm concerning the grave dangers of what is happening in Jerusalem, where extremist Israeli groups continue with their systematic and repeated incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Those incursions are aimed at imposing a new reality and at temporarily dividing Haram Al-Sharif by allowing extremists — under the protection of Israeli occupying forces, Ministers and Knesset members — to enter the Mosque. In so doing at specified times, they prevent the access of Muslim
worshipers from freely exercising their religious rights. The Israeli Government is pursuing that plan in direct violation of the status quo of 1967. The occupying Power is thus committing a grave mistake, because we will not accept such actions. The Palestinian people refuses to accept the implementation of an illegal plan that is an affront to the sensitivities of Palestinians and Muslims throughout the world. I call on the Israeli Government, before it is too late, to end the use of brutal force aimed at desecrating the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, and, in particular, to halt its actions directed against the Al-Aqsa Mosque, for such actions will transform the conflict from a political to a religious one and create an explosive situation in Jerusalem, as well as in the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory.
It is my honour to come to speak on behalf of the State of Palestine in the General Assembly at its seventieth session, which coincides with the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, which has made the promotion and protection of international peace and security and the preservation of human rights its primary goals.
The question of Palestine was one of the first just causes brought before the United Nations, dating from the time of its inception. Yet, to date, regrettably, it remains unresolved. The Organization and its Members remain unable to end the injustice inflicted upon our people or to assist it in exercising its right to self- determination and freedom in its own independent and sovereign State.
I ask the Assembly to reconsider the history of the question of Palestine and the relevant United Nations resolutions in order to realize a self-evident truth. A historic injustice was inflicted upon a people who had lived peacefully in their land and made genuine intellectual, cultural and humanitarian contributions to humankind and their homeland. That people does not deserve to be deprived of its homeland, to die in exile, to be swallowed by the sea or to spend its life fleeing from one refugee camp to another. Yet, regrettably, its just cause remains at a standstill after these many years.
Our people have placed their hopes in the countries of this Organization to help them to gain their freedom, independence and sovereignty, so that their wish and their right to their own State, which is the aspiration of all peoples of the Earth, can be achieved. That entails a just solution for the Palestine refugee issue
26/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
in accordance with resolution 194 (III) and the Arab Peace Initiative. Is that too much to ask?
We are calling for justice, peace and what is right. Palestine was partitioned into two States, and Israel was established 67 years ago. But the second part of resolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947, still awaits implementation. Palestine, which is an observer State in the United Nations, deserves full recognition and full membership. In the light of all the enormous sacrifices that we have made, our years of patience in exile and suffering, and our acceptance of peace in accordance with the two-State solution, which should be based on international law, the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet road map, it is unconscionable that the question of Palestine has remained unresolved for all these decades.
The continuation of the impasse is unacceptable, because it means yielding to the logic of the brute force that is being inflicted upon us by the Israeli Government. That Government continues its illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, especially in occupied East Jerusalem. It continues its blockade of the Gaza Strip, deepening the immense suffering of our people there, in defiance of United Nations resolutions and the agreements signed by both sides under international auspices. In that regard, we recall the words of the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1976, when he stated that Israel would become an apartheid State if it continued its occupation of Palestinian territory. He described the Israeli settlements on Palestinian land as a cancer. That is what Yitzhak Rabin said. Why do they do that to us?
The persistence of the issue forces us to ask the following questions. Do the votes of democratic countries against Palestine-related resolutions and the legitimate rights of our people serve peace and the interests of those who believe in the two-State solution? Or do they serve and encourage extremists, thereby fanning their hatred and racism and making them believe that they are above the law, to the point that they committed the crime of burning a Palestinian family in the town of Duma in the West Bank, a crime which claimed the lives of an infant, Ali Dawabsheh, his father and mother? What is left of this family is an orphan child, Ahmed, a 4-year-old, who teeters between life and death in hospital as a result of his burns, while the killers remain free because they have not yet been arrested. Where is justice? Where is fairness? Where
is democracy? Where is the democratic State that lays claim to democracy and the rule of law?
This was not the first crime of this type. On previous occasions, they had burned alive and killed a Palestinian child, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, in Jerusalem, and another, Mohammed Al-Dura, in Gaza, and before them thousands had been killed in Gaza and the West Bank. We still remember the Deir Yassin massacre of 1948 and all other crimes committed against our people. All of these crimes have gone unpunished. Until when will Israel remain above international law and without accountability?
Owing to time constraints, I shall not be able to discuss in detail how many Israeli violations have been committed against our people and how many repressive laws have been issued by successive Israeli Governments, the latest of which is the official governmental instructions given to fire live ammunition at and arrest and repress peaceful Palestinian demonstrators. Why is this happening?
We do not respond to the hatred and brutality of the Israeli occupation with hatred and brutality. Instead, we are working to spread the culture of peace and coexistence between our peoples and in our region. We are eager to see the day when our people and all peoples in our region will enjoy peace, security, stability and prosperity. This cannot be achieved with continued occupation, settlement, colonization, the wall, the burning of people, places of worship and homes, the killing of youth, children and infants, the burning of crops, and the arrest and detention of people without charge or trial.
How can a State claim that it is an oasis of democracy and that its courts and security apparatus function according to the law and yet also accept the existence of so-called price-tag gangs and other known terrorist organizations that terrorize and intimidate our people, confiscate their property and insult their holy sites? All of this occurs under the watch of the Israeli army and police, who do not deter or punish the gangs, but rather provide them with protection.
Is it not time to end these injustices? Is it not time to stop this suffering? Is it not time for the racist annexation wall to be torn down? Is it not time for the humiliating and degrading checkpoints and barriers set up by the Israeli occupying forces in our land to be removed? Is it not time for the Israeli blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip to be lifted so that our people can
15-29562 27/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
move in freedom and dignity in their own homeland and beyond? Is it not time to end the racist, terrorist, colonial settlement of our land, which is undermining the two-State solution? Is it not time for the 6,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails to see the light of freedom and live among their families and communities? Is it not time for the longest occupation in history, which is suffocating our people, to come to an end? These are the questions we ask the international community.
Despite all the obstacles imposed by the occupation, since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority and until this moment, we have worked tirelessly to build the foundations of our State, its infrastructure and sovereign national institutions. We have made real progress on the ground, as has been affirmed by several international bodies, in particular the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. With the support of our brothers and friends, we will continue our efforts and work together to strengthen our State, which is committed to upholding international standards, the rule of law and transparency as a democratic and modern State. In this context, we highly value the efforts of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, under Norway’s chairmanship, and urge donor countries to continue to support a better life for our people and our efforts to develop our State institutions.
Our membership in international organizations and our accession to treaties and conventions are not directed against anyone; rather, they are a measure aimed at safeguarding our rights, protecting our people, harmonizing the laws and regulations of our country with international standards, and strengthening its international legal status and identity. Is this a mistake?
With respect to the internal Palestinian situation, we are determined to preserve the unity of our land and our people. We will not accept temporary solutions or a fragmented State. We will not allow this to happen, and we will not let those who are trying to make us do this prevail. We will instead seek to form a Government of national unity that functions according to the programme of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and we will proceed to hold presidential and legislative elections.
Palestine is a country of holiness and peace. It is the birthplace of Christ, the messenger of love and peace, and the home of the Isra and Mi’raj, the ascension to
heaven and night journey of Mohammed, peace be upon him, who was sent as a gift of mercy to the world. Palestine is still looking for peace, and its people want to live in their homeland in safety, security, harmony, stability and good neighbourliness with all peoples and countries of the region. This is attested to by their cultural, humanitarian and spiritual contributions to humankind all along, from the start.
Just recently, on 17 May, two nuns from Palestine, Marie-Alphonsine Ghattas and Mariam Baouardy, were canonized as saints by His Holiness Pope Francis at the Vatican in the presence of tens of thousands of the faithful from around the globe. On that occasion, the flag of Palestine was raised at the Vatican, whose recognition of the State of Palestine is documented in the agreement signed between the Holy See and the State of Palestine. It is our hope that those that have not yet recognized us as a State will do so as soon as possible. We look forward to seeing the independent State of Palestine take its rightful place among the community of nations. We are confident that it will actively contribute to achieving the economic, cultural and humanitarian progress of civilization, with positive results for our people, the region and the entire world.
Peace will be achieved by and through Palestine. Those who wish to seek and promote peace, I repeat, those who wish to seek and promote peace and to fight terrorism, should start by resolving the question of Palestine. That is the beginning and the end of it.
I take the opportunity to express, on behalf of my people, our thanks to all those who, on 10 September, voted in favour of resolution 69/320. Its adoption has enabled us to raise the Palestinian flag at United Nations Headquarters. The day is not far off when, God willing, we will raise the Palestinian flag in East Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Palestine.
I wish also to pay tribute to various recent decisions in European parliaments. Some of these have clearly condemned Israel’s settlement activities and affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to sovereignty and independence in their own State, side by side with the State of Israel — which we recognize even though Israel does not recognize our existence — and some have established a committee on relations with Palestine. A number of European countries have also affirmed their recognition of the State of Palestine, thereby endorsing our natural right to independence. In that regard, we wish to thank the Kingdom of Sweden for having the
28/54 15-29562

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.19
courage of its convictions and recognizing the State of Palestine.
All who say they support the two-State solution must recognize both States, not just one. If one supports the two-State solution, how can one not recognize the other State? Today I call on those countries that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so. We are fully confident that they will do so out of conviction that our people and cause are deserving of justice. From this rostrum at United Nations Headquarters and against the backdrop of the religious holidays, I extend a sincere call on the people of Israel for peace based on justice, security and stability for all. I also call on the Security Council and the General Assembly to shoulder their responsibilities before it is too late. I sincerely hope that they will fulfil their responsibilities before it is too late.
All those present are well aware that Israel has undermined the efforts of the Administration of President Barack Obama, and mostly recently the efforts undertaken by Secretary of State Kerry, to reach a peace agreement by means of negotiation. The polices and practices of the Israeli Government and the stances adopted by its Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers lead to a clear conclusion, namely, that they are doing their utmost to sabotage the two-State solution that we have been seeking based on resolutions of international legitimacy. There can be no other explanation.
We welcome the international and European efforts, including the French initiative calling for the formation of an international support group on achieving peace. The Arab States, at their recent summit, confirmed their support for a Security Council resolution to reaffirm the key parameters for a peaceful two-State solution, based on the pre-1967 borders, with a time frame for ending the occupation.
As it is pointless to waste time negotiating just for the sake of it, what we require now is to mobilize international efforts and establish a framework to oversee an end to the occupation, in line with the resolutions of international legitimacy. Until that is done, I appeal to the United Nations, and particularly the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly, to provide international protection for the Palestinian people in accordance with international humanitarian law. We need protection — we need international protection. We cannot maintain the status quo. We are being assailed on all sides. Acts of
aggression are being committed against us on all sides. We have no protector. Our last resort is the United Nations. We are therefore appealing to the Assembly, we are begging the Assembly, to provide us with international protection.
We have tried to bring pressure to bear on Israel to implement the signed agreements and to negotiate in conformity with the two-State solution through direct contact with the Israeli Government. Yes, we do maintain direct contact with the Israeli Government, as well as indirect contact through the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United Nations, the Quartet members and other parties. However, the Israeli Government persists in undermining the two-State solution and in entrenching two regimes on the ground: the current apartheid regime imposed on the State of Palestine and against the Palestinian people, on the one hand, and another regime of extensive privileges and protection for Israeli settlers, on the other hand. Our occupied Palestinian territory reflects two systems: the apartheid system and the other system that extends extensive privileges to the Israeli settlers. How is that possible? In what way is it admissible? That is the question that we pose to the United Nations.
The transitional Oslo accords and annexes and the subsequent accords signed with Israel stipulated that the agreements should be implemented within a time frame of five years, which ended in 1999. What was the outcome to be? It was to be full independence for the State of Palestine and the end of the Israeli occupation. But Israel stopped withdrawing its forces from the areas classified as “B” and “C”, which represent more than 60 per cent of the West Bank territory, including East Jerusalem. Instead, Israel intensified its settlement activities everywhere, in breach of all of the signed accords, some of which were signed by the current Israeli Prime Minister.
In 2009, in his speech in Cairo, President Obama called for the cessation of the settlement activities. What was the response on the part of Israel? The Government increased its settlement activities by at least 20 per cent in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, thus violating its obligation not to undertake any illegal or unilateral action that could be considered permanent. Moreover, the occupying Power has repeatedly encroached on the area classified as “A”, which is supposed to be under full Palestinian security jurisdiction and in which we have
15-29562 29/54

A/70/PV.19 30/09/2015
established the institutions of the Palestinian State. Let me repeat that, yes, Israel has also violated that area.
At the same time, Israel refuses to review the economic agreements that control the ability of the Palestinian economy to develop and become independent. It is determined to impose dominance on the Palestinian economy, similar to its military and security dominance, and it rejects the right of the Palestinian people to development and to the exploitation of their natural resources. In so doing, Israel has undermined the foundations on which the political and security agreements are based. Those agreements have also been eroded by the measures taken by successive Israeli Governments, measures that have negated the transitional phase leading to the independence of our State. All these gross violations of the agreements have made the situation intolerable.
Given that background, we declare that as long as Israel refuses to commit to the agreements it signed with us, thereby ensuring that we are a pro forma authority without real powers, and as long as Israel refuses to cease its settlement activities and to release the fourth group of Palestinian prisoners in accordance with our agreements, Israel leaves us no choice but to assert that we will not remain the only ones committed to the implementation of those agreements, while Israel continuously violates them.
We therefore declare that we cannot continue to be bound by those agreements and that Israel must fully assume all its responsibilities as an occupying Power, because the status quo cannot continue and the decisions of the Palestinian Central Council last March are specific and binding. As long as Israel does not commit to the signed agreements and instead undermines them all, we, for our part, renounce our commitment to those agreements, and Israel must bear full responsibility for the situation. This is a decision taken by the Palestinian Parliament, and I affirm it right here and now. Our patience has run out. It seems that Israel is deaf to the truth. Israel will have to resume its role as an occupying Power and bear its responsibilities accordingly.
The State of Palestine, based on the 4 June 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, is a State under occupation. Yes, we are under occupation, just as many countries were during the Second World War. It should be noted that our State is recognized by 137 States, which is four times the number of States that recognized Israel at its foundation, and the right of our
people to self-determination, freedom and independence is recognized globally as being inalienable and indisputable. I further recall resolution 67/19 of 2012, which accorded to Palestine observer State status and reaffirmed that the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization would be the interim Government of the State of Palestine and that the Palestine National Council would be the Palestinian Parliament of the State of Palestine. Given all that, why does Israel not recognize the State of Palestine?
I must reiterate that the current situation is unsustainable. We shall start implementing the declaration I have just announced by legal means. We shall not resort to violence; we shall use peaceful and legal means to implement it. Either the Palestine National Authority will be a transitional power and move the Palestinian people from occupation to independence, or Israel must fully bear its responsibilities as the occupying Power.
At the same time, and based on our commitment to the principles of international law, the State of Palestine will continue to accede to international conventions and to join organizations — all international organizations. That is our right and is fully in line with our status under international law. Palestine will move forward in the defence of its people under occupation through all available legal and peaceful means, including as a High Contracting Party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and a State party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Yes, Palestine is a State party to the International Criminal Court. Those who fear international law and international courts should stop committing crimes. We do not like having to seek justice from the International Criminal Court, but aggression forces us to do so. We will seek support from all international organizations, including the International Criminal Court.
All that notwithstanding, my hand remains outstretched for the just peace that will guarantee my people’s rights, freedom and human dignity. I say to our neighbours, the sons and daughters of the Israeli people, that peace is in their interest and in our interest and in the interest of their future generations and our future generations. Maintaining a narrow viewpoint is unhelpful and destructive. Focusing only on oneself is unhelpful and destructive. It is my sincere hope that those neighbours will consider the dangerous reality on the ground and look to the future and accept for the Palestinian people what they accept for themselves.

Then, they will find that the achievement of peace will be possible, and they will enjoy security, safety, peace and stability. These values are the aspirations that we also seek to realize for our Palestinian people."
1,2013,"PSE","At the outset, 
I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk 
Jeremi. on his outstandingly successful presidency of 
the General Assembly at its previous session. I would 
also like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption 
of the presidency at its current session and to wish you 
every success.

I am pleased, indeed honoured, to address the 
Assembly today for the first time in the name of 
the State of Palestine, following the Assembly’s 
historic decision on 29 November of last year to raise 
Palestine’s status to that of a non-Member Observer 
State. As representatives of their Governments and 
peoples, Members have championed justice, right and 
peace, while affirming their rejection of occupation 
and standing for principles and ethics and on the side 
of peoples yearning for freedom. For that, I once again 
offer my deepest thanks and gratitude today on behalf 
of Palestine and its people. The Palestinian people 
celebrated resolution 67/19. They rightly felt that they 
were not alone in the world and that the world stood 
with them. They celebrated because they realized that 
the overwhelming result of the Assembly’s vote meant 
that justice was still possible and there was still room 
for hope.

I assured the Assembly last year that our quest to raise 
Palestine’s status was not aimed at delegitimizing an 
existing State, the State of Israel, but at consecrating — I 
repeat, consecrating — the legitimacy of a State that 
should exist, which is Palestine. I have also affirmed 
before the Assembly that our quest was not intended to 
affect the peace process, nor is it a substitute for serious 
negotiations. On the contrary, our quest is supportive of 
the choice of peace and has revived a process that was, 
in truth, moribund. As we have repeatedly affirmed and 
proved in practice, the State of Palestine, which abides 
by the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions 
of international legitimacy, will exercise its role and 
uphold its responsibilities within the international 
system in a positive and constructive manner that 
reinforces peace.

A new round of negotiations was launched a few 
weeks ago, thanks to the tireless and appreciated efforts 
of the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama, 
and of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. John 
Kerry. I affirm before the Assembly today that we 
have begun those negotiations and shall continue them 
in good faith and with open minds, strong will and 
determination and a sharp focus on success. I assure 
Members that we shall respect all of our commitments 
and foster the atmosphere most conducive to continuing 
the negotiations seriously and intensively, while 
providing guarantees for its success and aiming at a 
peace agreement within nine months.

As we engage in a new round of negotiations, we 
must remind everyone that we are not starting from a 
vacuum or from point zero, nor are we lost in a labyrinth 
without a map or a compass, at risk of losing sight of 
the destination. The goal of the peace that we seek is 
defined and the objective of the negotiations is clear 
to all, just as the terms of reference and the basis and 
foundations of the peace process and of the agreement 
we seek are longstanding and within reach.

As for the goal of peace, it is embodied in redressing 
the historic, unprecedented injustice that befell the 
Palestinian people in the Al-Nakba of 1948. It is the 
realization of a just peace, the fruits of which can be 
enjoyed by the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, as well 
as by all the peoples of our region.

The objective of the negotiations is to secure a 
lasting peace agreement that immediately leads to the 
establishment of the independence of a fully sovereign 
State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, 



on all of the Palestinian land occupied in 1967, so that 
it may live in peace and security alongside the State of 
Israel. The negotiations must also resolve the plight of 
Palestine refugees in a just, agreed-upon solution, in 
accordance with resolution 194 (III) and as called for 
by the Arab Peace Initiative.

We reaffirm our refusal to be drawn into the 
whirlpool of a new interim agreement aimed at the 
perpetuation of an interim State with interim borders, 
or to enter into transitional arrangements that will 
become the fixed rule rather than an urgent exception. 
Our goal is to achieve a permanent and comprehensive 
agreement and a peace treaty between the States of 
Palestine and Israel that resolves all outstanding issues, 
answers all questions and allows us to officially declare 
an end to the conflict and to all claims.

The terms of reference and parameters of the 
negotiations, their goals and the basis of the agreement 
we seek are all found in the Assembly’s historic decision 
to upgrade Palestine’s status, as well as in the countless 
resolutions of this body and of the Security Council 
and those of the League of Arab States, the European 
Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Union 
and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. In fact, 
over the years, the parameters have become the basis 
of an international consensus, indeed, near unanimity.

Exactly 20 years ago, precisely on 13 September 
1993, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the 
sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian 
people signed, together with the Government of Israel, 
the Declaration of Principles Agreement on the White 
House lawn in Washington, D.C, in the presence of our 
departed leader, Yasser Arafat, and Yitzhak Rabin, 
the late Israeli Prime Minister, the King of Jordan and 
former President Bill Clinton. 

Some five years earlier, on 15 November 1988, 
the Palestinian National Council had adopted our 
programme for the achievement of peace, thereby 
taking an extremely difficult decision and making a 
historic, painful and harmful concession. However, as 
representatives of the Palestinian people, and having 
long been aware of our responsibilities to them, we 
mustered the necessary courage to accept a two-State 
solution, namely, Palestine and Israel on the borders 
of 4 June 1967 and the establishment of a Palestinian 
State on 22 per cent of the land of historic Palestine. 
Thus we realized our part in achieving a historic 
settlement, upheld our obligations and fulfilled all of 
the requirements from the Palestinian side as set by the 
international community, in order to attain peace.

At the same time that the PLO affirmed its choice of 
peace as a strategic option and a solution resulting from 
negotiations, the PLO firmly repudiated violence and 
affirmed an ethical, principled rejection of terrorism 
in all its forms and manifestations — especially State 
terrorism — while affirming respect of international 
humanitarian law and United Nations resolutions.

As a genuine historic breakthrough, the signing 
of the Oslo Accords led to an unprecedented political 
movement that fostered great hopes and generated 
high expectations. The PLO worked with dedication to 
implement the Accords in order to end the occupation 
and to realize a just peace. However, 20 years on, the 
picture appears dispiriting and bleak: great dreams have 
been shattered and goals have become more modest. 

As much as we felt in those days that peace was 
at hand, today we realize how far we are from it, for 
the goal of the Accords has not been achieved, its 
provisions have not been implemented and its deadlines 
have not been respected. All the while, ongoing intense 
settlement construction, which aims to change the facts 
on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory, has 
violated the spirit of the agreement, struck at the core 
of the peace process and caused a deep fracture in its 
cornerstone, that is, the two-State solution.

The start of a new round of negotiations is good 
news, but it cannot serve as grounds for complacency 
or an exaggerated sense of tranquility on the part of 
the international community. The negotiations we 
are undertaking today with the Israeli Government 
under the auspices of the United States require that 
the international community exert every effort to 
make them succeed, namely, through international and 
regional organizations and individual States upholding 
the international consensus on the goal of peace, the 
objectives of the negotiations, the terms of reference 
and the basis for a permanent peace agreement.

However, at the same time, the international 
community is asked to remain vigilant. The international 
community must condemn and put an end to any actions 
on the ground that would undermine negotiations. In 
that regard, I refer above all to the continuation of 
settlement construction on Palestinian land, particularly 
in Jerusalem. There is an international consensus 
among the countries of the world, international and 
regional organizations and the International Court 



of Justice on the illegality and illegitimacy of those 
settlements. The position of the European Union with 
regard to settlement projects is a positive model of what 
can be done to ensure an environment supportive of 
and conducive to negotiations and the peace process. 
It is also imperative that the near-daily attacks on the 
religious sites in occupied Jerusalem, the foremost of 
which is the Al-Aqsa Mosque, cease, as the continuation 
of such attacks will have dire consequences.

History is the best teacher. It teaches us that waging 
war, imposing occupation and building settlements 
and walls may provide temporary quiet and temporary 
domination, but they certainly do not ensure real 
security or guarantee sustainable peace. Such policies 
may create a specific reality on the ground, but they 
certainly do not create a right or provide legitimacy. 
Such policies may impose weak stability, but they 
cannot prevent the inevitable explosion, because such 
polices in fact fuel situations that are already inflamed 
and cause them to explode. Above all, such policies are 
incapable of extinguishing the aspirations of a people 
for freedom, and cannot eradicate their living memory 
or their narrative.

Therefore, what is required now is to heed the 
lessons of history, to abandon the mentality of force 
and occupation, to recognize the rights of others 
and to work on an equal footing and in full parity to 
achieve peace. What is required is to stop relying on 
exaggerated security pretexts and obsessions in order to 
consecrate occupation and to stop contriving demands 
that push the conflict out of its defined political arena 
and towards the abyss of religious conflict in a region 
burdened with such sensitivities. That is something that 
we categorically reject.

I am confident that the Israeli people want peace 
and that a majority of them support a two-State solution. 
We have always expressed our firm positions and have 
always explained them at the negotiations table with the 
Israeli Government and in the meetings and contacts 
that we have intensified in recent years with a wide 
spectrum of actors from Israeli society.

Our message is rooted in the idea that the two 
peoples, the Palestinians and Israelis, are partners in 
the task of peacemaking. That is why we keep reaching 
out to the Israeli side, saying: let us work to make the 
culture of peace reign, to tear down walls, to build 
bridges instead of walls and to open wide roads for 
connections and communication. Let us sow the seeds 
of good-neighbourliness. Let us envision another future, 
one that the children of Palestine and Israel enjoy in 
peace and security, where they can dream and realize 
their dreams, a future that allows Muslims, Christians 
and Jews to freely reach their places of worship, and a 
future in which Israel gains the recognition of 57 Arab 
and Muslim States, the States of Palestine and coexists 
in peace and each of their peoples can realize their 
hopes for progress and prosperity.

While we discuss the realization of peace between 
Palestine and Israel as an imperative to achieve a 
comprehensive peace between the Arab countries and 
Israel in accordance with United Nations resolutions, 
we bear in mind the current volatile reality and 
unprecedented dynamics besetting our region. 
Palestine does not interfere in the internal affairs of 
Arab countries, but we have clearly affirmed our stance 
in support of the demands of the peoples of our region, 
their choices and their peaceful popular movements to 
achieve those demands, along with the programmes and 
road maps they have adopted to reach their goals. 

Furthermore, while we have condemned the crime 
of the use of chemical weapons in Syria, we have 
affirmed our rejection of a military solution there and 
stressed the need to find a peaceful political solution to 
fulfil the aspirations of the Syrian people.

The overwhelming majority of the Palestinian 
people were born in Palestine and were sent into exile 
after the 1948 Al-Nakba. However, 65 years afterwards, 
they continue to be its direct victims. Since the start of 
this year, 27 Palestinian citizens have been killed and 
951 have been wounded by the bullets of the occupation, 
and 5,000 fighters for freedom and peace are currently 
being held captive in occupation prisons. Does anyone 
deserve an end to this occupation and the realization of 
a just and immediate peace more than the Palestinian 
people?

This year and in the past few years, Palestinian 
refugees, despite their neutrality, have continued to pay 
the price of conflict and instability in our region. Tens 
of thousands have been forced to abandon their camps 
and to flee in another exodus, searching for new places 
of exile. Do the Palestinian people deserve justice less 
than the rest of the peoples of the world?

Since the beginning of the year, construction has 
been under way on thousands of settlement units by the 
occupation authorities, and construction tenders have 



been issued for thousands of others on our occupied 
land, even as additional vast areas of land are either 
expropriated or declared off limits; 850 homes and 
structures have been demolished.

Palestinians are forbidden to plant on their own land 
and to use the majority of the area of our country, which 
is only 22 per cent. They are prevented from using their 
own country’s water to irrigate their crops. The wall 
and checkpoints continue to tear apart the lives of the 
Palestinian people and to destroy their economy. The 
siege is growing tighter, along with the attacks and 
oppressive discriminatory measures against occupied 
Jerusalem, its holy places and its citizens. In Gaza, 
for years an unjust blockade has been imposed on our 
people.

So is there any people more deserving of freedom 
and independence than the Palestinians? Since the 
beginning of the year, 708 terrorist attacks have 
been perpetrated by settlers against our mosques and 
churches, our olive trees, our agricultural fields and our 
homes and property. Is there the shadow of a doubt in 
anyone’s mind that the Palestinian people have the most 
need of security?

Also, is there a nobler mission on the international 
community’s agenda than realizing a just peace in the 
land of the monotheistic faiths, the birthplace of Jesus 
Christ, the site of the ascent of the Prophet Muhammad 
and the resting place of Abraham, the father of the 
prophets?

As they remain steadfast on their land, the 
Palestinian people also continue to build their 
institutions, to strengthen internal unity, to achieve 
reconciliation by returning to the ballot box, to 
wage a peaceful and popular resistance to counter 
the oppression of occupation and of settlements and 
settler terrorism, and to hold fast to their rights. The 
Palestinian people do not want to remain “out of place”, 
in the words of Edward Said. Our people are waiting for 
the day when their cause ceases to be a fixed item on 
the agenda of the United Nations. Our people want to 
have freedom, God’s gift to humanity, and to enjoy the 
grace of living an ordinary life. For we, as Mahmoud 
Darwish wrote, cultivate hope and shall one day be 
what we want to be: a free, sovereign people on the land 
of the State of Palestine.

I personally am one of the victims of Al-Nakba, 
one of the hundreds of thousands of my people who 
were uprooted in 1948 from our beautiful world and 
thrown into exile. Like hundreds of thousands of other 
Palestine refugees, I knew as a youth the pain of exile 
and the tragedy of the loss of loved ones in massacres 
and wars, as well as the difficulties of building a new 
life from zero. In refugee camps and the diaspora, 
in exile, we knew the bitter taste of poverty, hunger, 
illness and humiliation, and the challenge of affirming 
one’s identity.

Our people have walked the path of armed revolution 
and have risen from the ashes of Al-Nakba. They have 
collected their shattered souls and identity to put their 
cause to the world and ensure that the recognition 
of their rights is enshrined. We have walked a long, 
difficult path and sacrificed dearly, and yet we have 
affirmed at all times our active quest for peace.

Twenty years ago, on behalf of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, I signed the Declaration 
of Principles Agreement, and we have since worked 
faithfully and diligently to implement it, affirming to 
all our respect for our commitments and the credibility 
of our positions. The successive setbacks encountered 
have not shaken our strong faith in the objective of a 
just peace, and we shall continue to work tirelessly 
and unwaveringly to see it realized. My own personal 
hope is to see the day when a just peace reigns so that 
the generation of Al-Nakba can pass on to its children 
and grandchildren the flag of an independent State of 
Palestine.

Time is running out; the window of hope is 
narrowing and opportunities are diminishing. The 
current round of negotiations appears to be a last 
chance to realize a just peace. The mere thought of the 
catastrophic and frightening consequences of failure 
must compel the international community to intensify 
efforts to seize this opportunity.

The hour of freedom for the Palestinian people has 
rung. The hour of the independence of Palestine has 
rung. The hour of peace for the two peoples — Israeli 
and Palestinian — has rung."
1,2016,"PSE","): I had hoped that I would not have to deliver this statement today, as would have been the case if the cause of my people had been genuinely heard and justly resolved and if hearts and minds had acted to lift my people from oppression.
As everyone is aware, we accepted the primacy of international law and the resolutions of international legitimacy, and made a historic and immense sacrifice when the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, accepted the establishment of the State of Palestine based on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
What more can be asked of us? We remain committed to the agreements reached with Israel in 1993. However, Israel must reciprocate and act forthwith to resolve all the final-status issues. It must cease all its settlement activities and acts of aggression against our cities, villages and refugee camps. It must cease its policies of collective punishment, its demolition of Palestinian homes, its extrajudicial executions and the arrest of our people. It must release our prisoners and detainees, all thousands of them, and cease its aggression and provocations against the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, for all these policies and practices prevent the creation of an environment in which peace can prevail in our region.
How can anyone seeking peace commit such actions? In this regard, we reaffirm that we find the current situation unacceptable. We will never accept the humiliation of our people. We will never accept temporary or interim solutions. Our people will never agree to forgo their national institutions and the other achievements that were won through great sacrifice, suffering and pain. We will preserve the independence of Palestinian decision-making. We will act to fulfil the aspirations of our people through political and diplomatic means, while relying on international law and the legitimacy of international resolutions via the United Nations and all international forums. We will seek to mobilize Arab and international efforts to that end. We will not accept the continuation of the status quo.
The 1993 Oslo Accords were intended to end the occupation, to achieve an independent State of Palestine within five years. Yet, Israel renounced the agreements it signed and persists in its occupation and continues to expand its illegal settlements, thereby undermining the realization of the two-State solution on the basis of the 1967 borders. Does Israel want one State? None of the 12 Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967 has been implemented, and Israel therefore pursues its plans for the seizure of more Palestinian land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with impunity. The violent actions of Israeli settlers have gone as far as the formation of terrorist groups that burn homes and kill entire families, destroy properties and uproot the trees that are the livelihood of Palestinian families.
Israel’s disrespect and contemptuous policies have led to attempts to legalize the settlements and the settlers’ colonization of our occupied land since 1967 and even to the Israeli Prime Minister’s claim that the call for the cessation of settlements and their dismantlement constitutes ethnic cleansing. All such claims and attempts are null and void; they are clearly in grave breach of international law.
So, who then is practising ethnic cleansing? In that regard, I am compelled to warn the General Assembly again that what the Israeli Government is doing in pursuit of its expansionist settlement plans will destroy whatever chance is left for the adoption of the two-State solution based on the 1967 borders. The settlements are illegal in every respect and in any form. We will therefore continue to exert all efforts for the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the settlements and the terror perpetrated by the settlers. To that end, we are currently undertaking extensive consultations with the Arab countries and other friendly countries. We hope that no one will cast a veto against this draft resolution.
The racial discrimination against the Palestinian people has become a daily reality as Israel continues to favour the Israeli settlers on our occupied land, including by granting them permits for residential construction, factories, economic projects and infrastructure, such as roads, electricity and water networks. At the same time, Israel is preventing the Palestinians — the owners of the land — from using their land and prohibiting them from developing their economy in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley and the Palestinian shores on the Dead Sea. It continues with its illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip, as well as with its illegal alteration of the identity and status of occupied East Jerusalem and its acts of aggression and provocation against our Christian and Muslim holy sites, especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque. That is playing with fire. I repeat, it is playing with fire. No one knows what may happen if those acts of aggression continue.
All of those Israeli policies, actions and measures are reasons for the failure of every international effort for the past 13 years, particularly those of the Quartet, in the same way that Israel has sabotaged the efforts of successive American Administrations over the decades. In that regard, I have to once again appeal to the United Nations to help provide international protection for the Palestinian people, who since 1967 have been suffering under occupation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip. I am very grateful in that regard to the Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council, who convened an Arria Formula meeting of the Council to explore the possibilities of international protection for our people, and I urge that such efforts continue. If the United Nations cannot ensure our protection, who will?
Today Israel continues its attempts to evade the possibility of an international conference for peace, an idea proposed by France and supported by most of the countries of the world. A ministerial meeting, in which 28 countries and three intergovernmental organizations participated, was held in Paris in June to prepare for the convening of such a conference. We continue to hope that holding such a conference can lead to the establishment of a mechanism and a defined time frame for ending the occupation, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative — which, among other things, calls for a just and agreed-on solution for Palestinian refugees, in accordance with resolution 194 (III). We hope that every country in the world will support convening such a peace conference before the end of this year. Without an international peace conference and direct negotiations between us and the Israelis, how can we make peace or even speak about it?
Instead of ensuring that Israel acknowledges the atrocities it continues to commit against our people, the Israeli Prime Minister has had the audacity to criticize Palestine’s statement at the Arab League Summit in Nouakchott, Mauritania, because it referred to the Balfour Declaration. I say to him today that our recognition in 1993 of the existence of the State of Israel, a recognition that continues to be valid, is not free of charge. Israel should reciprocate with its own recognition of the State of Palestine and end its occupation of our land, so that the State of Palestine and the State of Israel can coexist alongside each other, in peace and security, as good neighbours, each within secure and recognized borders.
There is no conflict between us and the Jewish religion and people. Our conflict is with the Israeli occupation of our land. We have full respect for the Jewish religion, which is a monotheistic one, just as we respect other religions, and in that regard we condemn the catastrophe of the Holocaust that befell the Jewish people in Europe during the Second World War. It was one of the most heinous crimes ever perpetrated against humankind. A historic reconciliation between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples requires that Israel acknowledge its responsibility for the Nakba that is still being inflicted on our people to this very day. Such an acknowledgement would open a new era of coexistence and serve to build bridges rather than walls. I believe that the Arab Peace Initiative embodies a reasonable, sensible solution. Yet Israel continues to insist on being selective, picking and choosing only parts of the Initiative, such as insisting on establishing relations with the Arab countries before ending its occupation of Palestine. That is simply a recipe for more conflict in the region. We will not accept it and neither will anyone else. The Arab Peace Initiative should be implemented in full, from A to Z, and Israel must understand that.
By the end of the coming year, 100 years will have passed since the Balfour Declaration; 70 since the Nakba of the Palestinian people; and 50 since Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Yes, 100 years have passed since the promulgation of the infamous Balfour Declaration, whereby Britain gave the land of Palestine to another people without any right, authority or consent from anyone. That paved the way for the Nakba and the Palestinian people’s dispossession and displacement from their land. As if that were not enough, the British mandate translated the Declaration into policies and measures that helped to perpetrate heinous crimes against a peaceful people in their own land, a people who had never attacked or taken part in a war against anyone. As we approach the 100th anniversary of that infamous Declaration, we would like to ask the British to draw the necessary lessons and shoulder their historical, legal, political, material and moral responsibilities for it, including an apology to the Palestinian people for the disasters, misery and injustice that it has created, and to act to rectify that historic catastrophe and remedy its consequences, including through recognition of the State of Palestine. That is the least Britain can do.
In addition, since 1948, Israel has persisted in its contempt for international legitimacy by violating resolution 181 (II), known as the partition resolution, which called for the establishment of two States on the historic land of Palestine according to a specific partition plan. Israeli forces seized more land than was allotted to Israel, constituting a grave breach of Articles 39, 41 and 42 of the Charter of the United Nations. In paragraph (c) of that resolution, the General Assembly requests that the Security Council
“determine as a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression, in accordance with Article 39 of the Charter, any attempt to alter by force the settlement envisaged by this resolution”.
Regrettably, however, the Security Council is not discharging its responsibility to hold Israel accountable for seizing territory allotted to the Palestinian State under the partition resolution. Over half of the Palestinian territory was taken by Israel. To reiterate, the Security Council is not discharging its responsibility to hold Israel accountable for its seizure of territory allotted to the Palestinian State under the partition resolution. I appeal to everyone to read resolution 181 (II) once again.
We continue our efforts to promote a culture of peace among our people. We stand firmly against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We condemn terrorism regardless of who perpetrates it or where it is perpetrated. Our region has been the principal victim of terrorism, a scourge that it has endured for many years. We support the unity of people and respect for territorial integrity. We are in favour of reaching political solutions for the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq and elsewhere. We commend the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to strengthen the foundations of legitimacy in Yemen. We support the efforts to confront and overcome terrorism, extremism, sectarianism and violence. I appeal to everyone to stand united against terrorism. Terrorism knows no religion.
In that connection, I wish to reaffirm that there is no way to defeat terrorism and extremism and achieve security and stability in our region unless we end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and ensure the freedom and independence of the Palestinian people. Fighting terrorism and extremism begins with the ending of the Israeli occupation of Palestine.
We continue our genuine, dedicated efforts to achieve Palestinian reconciliation with the formation of a national unity Government in accordance with the political platform of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections. We are committed to rebuilding Gaza, alleviating the hardships of our people and lifting the illegal blockade imposed on them.
Our hand remains outstretched to those interested in peacebuilding. There is one outstanding question that we have to keep asking over and over again, namely, is there any leader in Israel, the occupying Power, who truly desires to make peace and abandon the mentality of hegemony, expansionism and colonization? Is there any Israeli leader who will recognize the rights of our people and end the historical injustice inflicted upon them? It is Israel’s breach of the agreements it has signed and its failure to comply with the obligations it has assumed that have caused the deadlock and stalemate in which we find ourselves.
The State of Palestine, which was accorded the status of observer State in the United Nations with the support of 138 countries, is a State under occupation. The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization — the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people wherever they may be — acts on behalf of our people and as their Government. The Palestine National Council is the Parliament of the State of Palestine, as reflected in resolution 67/19.
We have not lost hope yet. We expect the international community to shoulder its responsibilities. We call on countries that have acted against our people to rectify such injustices. Moreover, we appeal to countries that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so. Those who believe in the two-State solution — and everyone speaks about the two-State solution — should recognize both States and not just one of them.
I invite the General Assembly to mark this seventy- first session by declaring 2017 as the international year to end the Israeli occupation of our land. In June 2017 half a century will have elapsed since the abhorrent Israeli occupation began. I also appeal to members, as a follow-up to resolution 67/19, to adopt a draft resolution that will enable Palestine to submit and co-sponsor draft resolutions on subjects other than the question of Palestine and to support our efforts to enhance Palestine’s legal and political status by granting it additional responsibilities to chair committees and groups as we continue our quest for full membership in international organizations.
Given all this, the international community is called upon, now more than ever, to exert all efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the land of the State of Palestine. As members are aware, this is the longest and the last occupation in contemporary history. If the international community were to deliver on its ability to advance the rights of our people, ensure the exercise of those same rights and end the oppression and injustice imposed on our people for seven decades, that would surely present a unique opportunity for peace, stability and coexistence in our region and between the Palestinian and Israeli people. It would create a better future for the current generation and succeeding generations. It would be a beginning, a basis for ending extremism and violence in our region and the world.
I hope, from the depths of my heart, that the Israeli occupation of our land will end, that we can defeat terrorism, that the current conflicts will be concluded and that peace will prevail in our region and around the world. Our people will continue to open the door to peace and do all we can to grant our people freedom and independence. We will remain steadfast in our land, and we will work to prepare the future of the next generation. It is my hope that I will not have to deliver this same statement again next year. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that 2017 is the year when the occupation ends. Will the Assembly discharge that responsibility? I truly hope so."
1,2017,"PSE","Twenty- four years have passed since the signing of the Oslo Accords, an interim agreement that set a five-year period for bringing an end to the Israeli occupation, giving hope to the Palestinian people that they would soon achieve independence within their State and peace between Palestinians and Israelis. What is left of that hope today? We recognized the State of Israel within the 1967 borders, but Israel’s continued refusal to do the same has called into question the mutual recognition that we signed in Oslo in 1993.
Since my address to the Assembly last year (see A/71/PV.14), when I urged us to make 2017 the year for ending the Israeli occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine, the Israeli Government has relentlessly pursued its settlement campaign on our land, in contravention of all international conventions and the relevant resolutions on the question of Palestine. It has also persisted in its flagrant disregard for reaching a
17-29395 7/29 two-State solution, resorting to delaying policies and tactics and devising pretexts to evade its responsibility for ending its occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine. Instead of addressing the underlying issues and resolving the root causes of the conflict, it has tried to divert international attention to secondary issues that in fact are caused by its colonial policies.
While we continue to call — as does the international community — for an end to the Israeli occupation of our State’s territory, Israel incites trouble and makes false accusations, pretends that there is no Palestinian partner and imposes unreasonable, obstructive conditions. Israel is well aware, as we all are, that its occupation breeds provocations and violence. Its military occupation of our land has now lasted for more than half a century.
Ten years ago, in a decision made by the United States, we agreed together to establish a tripartite committee to address the issue of incitement, made up of the United States, Palestine and Israel. The committee worked for some time but was eventually disbanded, and since then we have called for its revival, to no avail. Who is committing incitement now? And who is trying to maintain it? It is therefore very strange to hear some of those who should be responsible for ending the occupation refer to it as a half-occupation, or an alleged occupation.
What is meant by “alleged occupation”? For 50 years we have languished under the yoke of occupation, and now someone who is responsible says that this is an alleged occupation. That is unfair, wrong and unacceptable. Israel’s continuation of the occupation is an affront to the international community. The United Nations has a legal, political, moral and humanitarian obligation to end it and enable the Palestinian people to live in freedom and prosperity in their independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital and within the 4 June 1967 borders. That is the responsibility of the United Nations and the international community.
There can be no doubt that draining the quagmire of the colonial occupation of our land and ending its unjust, oppressive and illegal practices against our people would have an enormous effect on the fight against terrorism, thereby depriving terrorist groups of one of the key rallying cries they exploit to promote their obscurantist ideas. We therefore reiterate that it is vitally urgent to end the Israeli occupation of our land, since it is an integral part of the efforts that we must all make to confront such groups. Palestinians oppose all internal and international terrorist organizations, whatever their nature, origins or character. We stand against international terrorism and we are fighting it.
We have explored every avenue and exerted enormous efforts to achieve peace with our Israeli neighbours. Together with other Arab and Islamic States, we have adopted the invaluable Arab Peace Initiative, aimed at resolving the Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict. The Initiative states that upon Israel’s withdrawal from the Palestinian and Arab territories — the Golan and Shaba’a farmlands — occupied since 1967, the Arab and Islamic States will recognize Israel and normalize relations with it. What has been the Israeli response? Fifty-seven Arab and Islamic States have said that they are ready to recognize and normalize relations with Israel, but Israel is not interested.
In 2003, there was also the 2003 Quartet road map for an Israeli-Palestinian peace, endorsed by the Security Council and accepted by Palestine. It, too, was rejected by the Israeli Government — so apparently Israel is above the law. Next, a French-led initiative for peace attempted to break the stalemate in the peace process and ensure a successful effort to salvage the peace process and a two-State solution. It led to the convening earlier this year in Paris of the Conference for Peace in the Middle East, which was attended by 70 States and four international organizations. Israel has rejected and boycotted all of those efforts. Besides those I have already mentioned, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China have also launched initiatives for peace. The latest of those peace efforts — all of which we are grateful for — is being led by United States President Donald Trump. Where are those initiatives and why will Israel not accept them?
For our part, we have also repeatedly tried to revive the peace process. We have called on the Israeli Prime Minister simply to affirm his commitment to a two- State solution and sit with us at the negotiation table to delineate the borders between Israel and the State of Palestine in order to open a path for meaningful talks on resolving all the other final status issues. Unfortunately, he rejected that offer. We have continued our genuine efforts to achieve a successful peace process, and Israel nonetheless continues to ignore its commitments and obstruct those efforts through its relentless settlement activities. There is no place left for the State of Palestine, and that is unacceptable both to us and to those here in this Hall. The fact is that Israel is rejecting a two-State solution, posing a real threat to Israelis and Palestinians alike. We will therefore be compelled to undertake a comprehensive strategic review of the entire process.
A commitment to peace by one side is never enough to achieve peace. Either we are free or not free. We have issued warnings in the past, and continue to do so today, about the Israeli policies aimed at entrenching the occupation and colonial facts on the ground in East Jerusalem. We have pointed out that those policies fuel religious animosity and could lead to a violent religious conflict. We have called on the Israeli Government to uphold the historic and legal status quo of the city’s holy sites. However, since its occupation of East Jerusalem in 1967, the Israeli Government has repeatedly and unilaterally annexed Jerusalem. Jerusalem is occupied. It also decided to annex Golan, and did so. We rejected that at the time and continue to do so, together with the entier international community, including the Security Council.
The Security Council, the principal world authority on peace and security, has adopted numerous resolutions stating that such annexation processes are illegal. To whom should we turn? Since the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions are not being implemented, to whom should we turn? We have not chosen a path of terrorism or violence. Jerusalem is an occupied city. Israel’s decisions and practices there are null and void and entirely illegal. The same applies to all the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory.
Israel’s attempts to change the historic status quo in Al-Quds and particularly the status and integrity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque can be described only as playing with fire and an infringement on our responsibilities and those of our brother country Jordan. We are both responsible for the city. We have warned the Israeli Government about the implications of such an act of aggression and will hold it fully responsible for the consequences. We do not desire a religious war, which would be dangerous for everyone. Our conflict is political, not religious, so let us leave religious issues out of the equation.
Despite the ongoing occupation and its oppressive policies and practices, we have been working effectively to build the institutions of our State, which has been recognized by a majority — 138 of those present — of the States Members of the United Nations. I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank all of the countries that have recognized the State of Palestine and have voted for upgrading its status at the United Nations. That is certainly helping to remedy the historic injustice that has befallen our people and showing support for the goal of peace between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East and around the world.
I also stressed in my address to the Assembly last year that the status quo in the occupied territory of the State of Palestine is unsustainable. However, since the situation has only deteriorated, owing to Israel’s insistence on pursuing its occupation, aggressive policies and unending violations of international law, we must once again call on Israel, as the occupying Power, to fully respect and uphold all the obligations that its occupation implies and bear the consequences.
We cannot continue to be an Authority that has no authority or to allow the occupation to continue at no cost. We are fast approaching that point. If Israel does not want a two-State solution, if it does not want peace, let it assume its responsibilities and bear their consequences, because we will not bear those responsibilities for them. Today a two-State solution is in jeopardy. As Palestinians, we cannot stand still in the face of that threat, which is targeting our national, political and social existence on our land and endangering regional and international peace and security. We will have to take steps or look for alternatives in order to preserve our national existence and maintain the prospects for peace and security. But any option we try will be peaceful.
In such a situation, we have the right to seek alternatives that preserve our rights and protect our land and our people from a hardening system of the type of apartheid that ended in South Africa long ago but that continues to persist in Palestine. Is that acceptable? Can the world accept an apartheid regime in the twenty-first century in Palestine? Why, then, is there one?
On the other hand, we have called on the International Criminal Court, which is our right. If nobody wants to listen to us, then we will pursue all avenues to justice. We have called on the International Criminal Court to open an investigation and prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people. We will continue to pursue our accessions to international conventions, protocols and organizations, as Palestine has acquired observer status pursuant to resolution of 2012. I will convene the Palestinian National Council in the near future to operationalize a strategic review of these efforts.
Palestinians, Arabs and the world as a whole have a choice as to whether to respect international law and implement the two-State solution based on the 1967 borders. We will give the efforts being undertaken by President Donald Trump, the Quartet and the international community at large every chance to succeed so that a historic agreement or deal may be reached. We have heard that they are trying to strike a historic deal. We would like to thank them and hope that it will come to fruition soon.
We stress the two-State solution, which would enable the State of Palestine to live side-by-side with the State of Israel in security and peace. But if the two-State solution were to be fall apart due to the establishment of a one-State reality with two systems — a system of apartheid — following the unchecked imposition of the occupation that our people and the international community reject, that would be a failure, and neither the international community nor we will have any other choice but to continue the struggle and demand full and equal rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine. This is not a threat, but we are warning Israel of the realities and the consequences of its ongoing policies that are gravely undermining the two-State solution. What do the Israelis want? Even if they talk about other issues, we continue to choose the two-State solution.
Our problem is with the Israeli colonial occupation, not with Judaism as a religion. Judaism for us Palestinians, be they Christian or Muslim, will never be considered a threat. It is an Abrahamic religion, like Islam and Christianity. God Almighty tells us in the Qur’an that, in the name of God the Compassionate and the Merciful, we should not distinguish between his messengers. Indeed, all His messengers — Mohammed, Jesus and others — are equal. All these religions are equal, and we do not make distinctions between prophets or messengers. On this occasion, we congratulate the Jews on their new year. We would also like to congratulate Muslims for their new Hijri year starting tomorrow. This is proof of our desire for a rapprochement among religions.
We have dutifully upheld our responsibilities towards our people in the Gaza Strip despite the split with Hamas that has been in place since 2007. Since that time, we have provided all forms of support on our own to our people in Gaza, who are gravely suffering from the cruel Israeli blockade. We have repeatedly affirmed that no one is more aware of the interests of our people in Gaza Strip than we are. We are eager to see to the interests of the people in Gaza served. We have said that there will be no State in Gaza alone and there will be no Palestinian State without the Gaza Strip. A State in Gaza alone is a false dream, and our State will be complete only when the Gaza Strip is part of it.
I must express my relief at the agreement reached in Cairo as a result of Egyptian efforts. We are grateful for those efforts aimed at nullifying the measures taken by Hamas following the split with us, including the formation of a Government. The Hamas Government has been cancelled, and there is now a commitment to the National Unity Government, which is a Government of national consensus, which will enable it to exercise its authority in the Gaza Strip and allow for general elections to be held. This agreement has met with our satisfaction. Next week, our Government is going to the Gaza Strip to assume its responsibilities. We wish the Government every success.
In my address to the General Assembly last year, I appealed to the Government of the United Kingdom to rectify the grave injustice it inflicted upon the Palestinian people when, in 1917, it issued the Balfour Declaration, promising Jews a national homeland in Palestine, despite the fact that Palestine was inhabited by the Palestinian people. Some 97 per cent of the population of Palestine at that time were Palestinians, who were disregarded. Again, Palestine at that time was inhabited by the Palestinian people and was among the most progressive and prosperous countries in the region. It should not have been colonized or placed under the mandate of a great Power. The British Government has not taken a single step to date to correct this historical injustice against our people. It should apologize, provide us with reparations and recognize the State of Palestine. We talked to its representatives at length and so far they have not provided a response. What is even worse is that in November they want to celebrate the centenary of this crime against our people.
The silence of the international community with respect to Israel’s aggressive policies has emboldened the country to continue its policies. I would remind the Assembly that, since its establishment, Israel has violated numerous provisions of international law. It has violated the Charter of the United Nations and continues to do so. It has violated General Assembly resolutions 181 (II), 194 (III) and Security Council resolution 242 (1967). We would recall that Article 42 of the Charter of the United Nations provides for the possible use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security. This could apply to those who conduct acts of aggression against the land of others.
Israel has taken a large part of our territory and was not deterred from doing so by the United Nations. Resolution 194 (III) provided for the return of refugees at that time. However, the United Nations did not adopt any follow-up resolution. Security Council resolutions have called for withdrawal from the occupied territories. Where are those resolutions? If the United Nations cannot implement its resolutions, who will? Israel does not want to. Is Israel above the law? There are double standards in dealing with different countries. That is the Assembly’s responsibility.
To salvage the peace process and the two-State solution, I urge the Organization and its Member States to adopt the following measures.
First, they should actively pursue efforts to bring an end to the Israeli occupation of the State of Palestine within a set time frame. It is no longer enough to issue generic statements calling for the end to the occupation and the achievement of peace without a deadline. Efforts must be made to implement the Arab Peace Initiative, including a just solution for the Palestinian refugee question, in accordance with resolution 194 (III). The Arab Peace Initiative addressed the issue of refugees very well in referring to a just and agreed- upon solution, not one imposed upon a certain party, in accordance with resolution 194 (III). Israel disregarded those resolutions, riding roughshod over them. To whom should we complain?
Second, they should act to bring to a halt to all settlement activities in occupied Palestinian land, as demanded in numerous United Nations resolutions, including the most recent Security Council resolution, 2334 (2016), in addition to the operative paragraphs of the Fourth Geneva Convention. An occupying Power should not expel the people from their land. This is in the text of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Who is responsible for implementing those texts? Israel refuses to do so. What is the international community doing?
Third, the Organization and Member States should ensure international protection to the lands and people of the State of Palestine until the occupation ends, as we are unable to provide protection to our people. Given all the forces, the arms that we are facing every day, who will protect us if the Member States do not? Many times we have put forward draft resolutions, but they are in vain.
Fourth, they should demand that Israel endorse and commit to the borders of 1967 as the basis for the two-State solution and set such borders in line with international resolutions. Once we delineate the borders, each party can act in its territory as it pleases without affecting or damaging the rights of the other party. Israel builds wherever it wants today, demolishing houses every day; even schools and hospitals are being demolished. Nobody raises an eyebrow.
Fifth, I must ask all the Member States of the United Nations that have recognized Israel to state that they have recognized Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders, thereby aligning themselves with international resolutions and reaffirming their commitment to those resolutions — even those who recognized Israel on the basis of resolution 181 (II). Resolution 181 (II) was violated. Hence my question: where are the borders of Israel that Member States are recognizing? How can Member States recognize a State that has no borders? Israel has not even decided on its own borders. Yet international law states that a State is a land with borders. But Israel has no borders. How can one recognize a State that has no clearly demarcated borders?
Sixth, I call on all States to end all forms of direct and indirect involvement with, and support to, the illegal Israeli colonial settlement regime on the land of the occupied State of Palestine, in accordance with United Nations resolutions and the affirmed positions of States in that regard. Such action would be similar to the international community’s approach to the apartheid regime in South Africa. We should not deal with settlements. We should not condone settlements. The black list of countries that are dealing illegally with Israeli settlements should be exposed.
Seventh, I urge those States that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to do so. I do not understand how recognizing the State of Palestine within the 1967 borders harms the chances of peace. There could be minor amendments agreed between the two parties, but the basis is 1967, so our borders are well known. Where are the borders of Israel? How can recognizing the State of Palestine harm the chances of peace, especially since we Palestinians have recognized the State of Israel within the 1967 borders?
Eighth, we look to the Security Council to approve our application for full membership of the State of Palestine in the United Nations. What do we lack? What is missing? Every day we prove that we are eligible for such status. All those who support the two-State solution should recognize two States, not one State — Palestine and Israel. If a Member State recognizes Israel, it should recognize Palestine.
Ninth, we urge the international community to continue providing economic and financial support to the Palestinian people to achieve self-reliance. If the occupation ends we will say “thank you”. We will be self-reliant. Unfortunately, because we are under occupation, we can only seek assistance, and we are grateful to the international community because it is providing assistance. Help us to rid ourselves of the occupation, and we will thank Member States for their help.
We also urge the international community to continue providing support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to enable it to continue providing humanitarian assistance. In that connection, we warn against attempts to eliminate item 7 on the agenda of the Human Rights Council, or to change the mandate of UNRWA.
Efforts are also under way to obstruct the issuance of the list of companies operating in Israeli settlements. That is a black list. Why should we hide that list? It is similar to terrorism. Everybody should see the list to know who violates international law and who respects such law.
Tenth, we once again affirm our commitment to respecting human rights and international conventions, and to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and all other treaties and conventions that we have acceded to. We respect everything that we have acceded to or adopted, and we go hand in hand with the international community, of which we are part of.
The State of Palestine will reflect those imperatives, where appropriate, in the draft resolutions to be presented to the General Assembly. We call on the Assembly to vote in favour of those draft resolutions, with the clear aim of preserving the two-State solution, salvaging and promoting peace and achieving security and stability and prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians and for the people of the entire region.
In conclusion, allow me to salute our great people, who remain steadfast in their homeland despite their suffering and peaceful struggle against foreign occupation. The culture of peace is prevailing among Palestinians. Those joining Da’esh and the Al-Nusra Front are not from Palestine.
I salute our people of Jerusalem, who exhibited one of the most shining examples of peaceful popular resistance against the Israeli colonial occupation. When they were prevented from praying, they prayed outside — they prayed and were victorious. I salute our people in exile and in the diaspora. I salute our people who remain steadfast in the West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip. I salute our glorious martyrs and our courageous prisoners in Israeli prisons.
I tell them all that freedom is coming and is inevitable and that the occupation will come to an end. That will come about either with the independence of the State of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel on the 1967 borders, or, if Israel chooses, with equal rights for all of the inhabitants of the land of historic Palestine from the river to the sea. Which will they accept?
When South Africa was liberated from the apartheid regime, Nelson Mandela said that he was grateful to the whole world and the United Nations, which contributed to and supported the end of apartheid in South Africa. Mandela added that their victory would not be complete until the Palestinian people were victorious. We, together with the Assembly, are entrusted to end the apartheid in Palestine — person by person, State by State, including the super-Powers. All of us should stand together. It is a commitment that should be fulfilled. Will the Assembly fulfil its duty? I very much hope so."
1,2014,"PSE","In this year 
2014, proclaimed by the General Assembly as the 
International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian 
People, Israel has chosen to make it the year of a new 
war of genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian 
people. It is the year in which the Assembly, on behalf 
of the countries and peoples of the world, conveyed 
the world’s yearning and determination to make a just 
peace that would achieve freedom and independence 
for the Palestinian people in their State of Palestine 
alongside Israel. The occupying Power has chosen to 
defy the entire world by launching its war on Gaza, in 
which its jets and tanks brutally destroyed lives and 
devastated the homes, schools and dreams of thousands 
of Palestinian children, women and men and, in reality, 
destroying any remaining hopes for peace.

I addressed the Assembly on similar days in 2012 
(see A/67/PV.12), when I cautioned that the colonial 
occupying Power was preparing a new Nakba against 
the Palestinian people. I appealed to the Assembly then 
to prevent a new Nakba and to support the establishment 
of a free and independent State of Palestine. I returned 
to the Assembly Hall two months later (see A/67/PV.44) 
as Palestine was healing its wounds and its people were 
burying their beloved martyred children, women and 
men after yet another war waged then against the Gaza 
Strip. On that day, I stated that there was certainly 
not a single person in the world who needed the loss 
of the lives of thousands of Palestinian children in 
order to confirm that Israel insisted on occupation. The 
international community also did not need thousands 

of deadly raids and tons of explosives to remind it that 
there was an occupation that must end and a people who 
must be freed.

Again today, we find ourselves full of grief and 
bitterness, raising the same long-standing conclusions 
and questions after a new war, the third in five years, 
waged by that racist occupying State against Gaza, 
a small, densely populated and precious part of our 
country. The difference today is that the scale of 
that genocidal crime is larger. The list of martyrs, 
especially children, has grown, as hs the number of 
the wounded, the disabled and the dozens of families 
who have been completely decimated. The difference 
today is that approximately half a million people have 
been displaced from their homes. An unprecedented 
number of homes, schools, hospitals, public buildings, 
residential buildings, mosques, factories and cemeteries 
have been destroyed — the Israelis pursued their 
vengeance against our young even into the cemeteries. 
The difference today is that the devastation caused by 
that recent aggression is unmatched in modern times, 
as confirmed by a witness, the Commissioner-General 
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

The latest war against Gaza constituted a series 
of absolute war crimes, carried out before the eyes 
and ears of the entire world, moment by moment. It 
is inconceivable that anyone today could claim not to 
grasp the magnitude and horror of the crimes. No one 
can support Israel’s right to self-defence without regard 
for the fate of the thousands of victims of our people. 
No one can ignore the simple fact, upon which we 
insist, that the life of a Palestinian is as precious as the 
life of any other human being. Ignoring the facts on the 
ground cannot erase such facts. We must also assume 
that no one can continue to wonder why extremism is 
rising and why the culture of peace is losing ground 
and receding, while efforts to achieve it are collapsing. 
And yet we continue to believe and hope that this time 
no one will try to help out the occupation by supporting 
its impunity and its attempts to evade accountability 
for its crimes.

Here, today, in the name of Palestine, I affirm that 
we will not forget or forgive, and we will not allow war 
criminals to escape punishment. Before the Assembly, 
I affirm that the Palestinian people will hold fast to 
their legitimate right to defend themselves against the 
Israeli war machine and to resist Israel’s colonial, racist 
occupation. At the same time, I want to affirm that not 
for one moment will our grief, trauma and anger make 
us abandon our humanity, our values and our ethics. We 
will always maintain our respect for and commitment 
to international law, international humanitarian law 
and the international consensus. We will maintain the 
traditions of our national struggle established by the 
Palestinian martyrs, to which we have been committed 
since the start of the Palestinian revolution in early 
1965.

In the midst of a torrent of massacres and the 
turmoil of vast destruction, we saw the peoples of the 
world gather in huge demonstrations on the streets of 
many cities to announce their condemnation of Israel’s 
aggression and occupation and their support of freedom 
for Palestine. We also saw how an overwhelming 
majority of countries around the world declared 
themselves for the same noble position and rushed to 
give our people all kinds of support and assistance. 
And we saw a qualitative and quantitative expansion in 
the activities of the international grassroots boycotting 
campaign against Israel’s policies of occupation, 
apartheid and colonial settlement, especially among 
academic, cultural, student and youth groups. In the 
name of Palestine, we pay tribute to all who chose 
to stand with human values and demanded freedom, 
justice and peace. All of those manifestations of true 
solidarity constituted an important message to those 
who faced genocide in Gaza, helping them to feel that 
they were not alone.

The recent war confirmed on the ground the 
essence of what the Israeli Government had been saying 
behind closed doors in negotiations. It came after long, 
difficult negotiations held over more than eight months 
under the auspices of the United States and through the 
efforts of President Barack Obama and his tenacious 
Secretary of State, John Kerry. We engaged in that 
endeavour and with the American Administration’s 
efforts with open minds and in good faith and a positive 
spirit. We laid out firm positions based on resolutions 
of international legitimacy. We genuinely respected 
all our commitments and understandings. Even as we 
watched the ongoing and escalating Israeli violations, 
we exercised incredible self-restraint, silencing our 
cries and tending to our own wounds in order to give the 
American efforts the best possible chance for success.

However, as usual, the Israeli Government missed 
no opportunity to undermine the chances for peace. 
Throughout the months of negotiations, settlement 
construction, land confiscation, home demolition, 


killing and arrest campaigns and large-scale forced 
displacement in the West Bank continued unabated. The 
unjust blockade of the Gaza Strip was tightened. The 
occupation’s campaign specifically targeted the city of 
Jerusalem and its inhabitants, attempting to artificially 
alter the spirit, identity and character of the Holy City 
and focusing on Al-Aqsa Mosque while threatening 
grave consequences. At the same time, armed gangs 
of racist settlers persisted in their crimes against the 
Palestinian people and their land, mosques, churches, 
property and olive trees.

Again as usual, the Israeli Government failed 
the test of peace. It breached an agreement with the 
United States Administration regarding the release 
from the occupation jails of a number of Palestinian 
prisoners, who we continue to insist should all be 
released. When confronted with simple questions 
during the direct negotiations or through the United 
States mediator, Israel had no hesitation in revealing 
its true positions. It refuses to end the occupation of 
the State of Palestine that began in 1967; rather it seeks 
to continue and entrench it, rejecting the Palestinian 
State and refusing to reach a just solution to the plight 
of the Palestine refugees. That is the Government of 
Israel’s official position. At best, the future it proposes 
for the Palestinian people consists of isolated ghettos 
for Palestinians on fragmented lands, without borders 
or sovereignty over its air space, water and natural 
resources, under the subjugation and control of the 
racist settlers and the army of occupation; at worst, it 
is a totally abhorrent form of apartheid. Some of the 
Israelis say they are for two States. Where is the State 
of Palestine? This is what they intend for the State of 
Palestine.

Israel confirmed during the negotiations that it 
rejects making peace with its victims, the Palestinian 
people. All of this has been carried out along with 
an attempt to brand the conflict as a religious one 
against a background of increasingly rampant racism 
in Israel’s political and media discourse, as well as its 
entrenchment in the school curriculum and a series 
of laws and practices in favour of the occupation and 
its settlers. This culture of racism, incitement and 
hatred was glaringly apparent some months ago in 
an appallingly despicable crime committed by fascist 
settlers, who abducted Mohammed Abu Khdeir, a 
young boy from Jerusalem, burned him alive and killed 
him.

This brings me to another fact of history. Over the 
years, the occupying Power has pursued a policy aimed 
at deliberately weakening the Palestinian National 
Authority in order to undermine it and make its role 
irrelevant. The occupation has targeted our relentless 
efforts to establish the foundations for the kind of 
State of Palestine that we want — a sovereign and 
independent State living in peace and building bridges 
of mutual cooperation with its neighbours, respecting 
its commitments, obligations and agreements and 
strengthening the values of citizenship, equality, 
nondiscrimination, the rule of law, human rights and 
pluralism.

We want a State that deepens Palestine’s enlightened 
traditions of tolerance, coexistence and non-exclusion, 
strengthens the culture of peace, promotes the role 
of women, establishes an effective administration 
committed to the standards of good governance, and 
cares for the needs and interests of its people. The 
occupation struck, and continues to strike, a blow at 
this effort because our quest is the antithesis of Israel’s 
settlement policies, and because Israel seeks to destroy 
Palestine’s chance of creating an independent State 
within the framework of the two-State solution.

When our efforts to end the internal division 
through national dialogue succeeded a few months ago 
and we prepared to restore the unity of our land, nation 
and institutions, we formed a national-consensus 
Government and began a process that was to lead to 
presidential and legislative elections. All countries 
around the world welcomed this achievement, with 
the exception of Israel, which has constantly sought to 
fragment our land and our national unity.

Where do we go from here? The idea that one can 
simply return to the past patterns of actions that failed 
repeatedly is naive at best and, in any case, wrong. 
For it ignores the fact that it is no longer acceptable or 
possible to repeat methods that have proved futile, or 
to continue with approaches that have repeatedly failed 
and that require comprehensive review and radical 
correction.

It is impossible — I repeat, impossible — to return 
to the cycle of negotiations that failed to deal with 
the core of the Palestinian question. There is neither 
credibility nor seriousness in negotiations in which 
Israel predetermines the results via its settlement 
activities and the occupation’s brutality. Nor is there 
meaning or value in negotiations in which the agreed 


objective is not ending the Israeli occupation and 
achieving the independence of the State of Palestine, 
with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the entire 
Palestinian territory occupied in the 1967 war. Moreover, 
negotiations that are not linked to a firm timetable for 
the implementation of this goal have no value. The time 
has come to end this colonial occupation.

Palestine refuses to have the right to freedom of its 
people, who suffer terrorism at the hands of the racist 
occupying Power and its settlers and remain hostage 
to Israel’s security conditions. The Palestinian people 
are actually the ones who need immediate international 
protection — a protection they are seeking through 
international organizations. They are in need of the 
security and peace that they more than any other people 
are denied. And the children of Palestine are worthy 
of the world’s efforts to ensure that their childhood, 
dreams and lives will not once again be destroyed. It is 
time for the chapters of this renewed, ongoing tragedy 
to be closed.

Those who were uprooted from their warm homes, 
good land and beautiful country in Al-Nakba 66 years 
ago, who were pushed into the misery of exile to live 
as refugees, and are now being forced into new waves 
of expulsion or onto ships of death on the world’s seas, 
need assurances. They need to be assured that they 
will not be displaced from their homes again, that their 
homes will not be destroyed again, and that they will 
not spend their lives waiting for the outbreak of a new 
war. Is it not time for this long tragedy to end?

We will not forever accept demands to prove our 
good intentions by making concessions at the expense 
of our rights, to remain silent as we are killed and our 
land is stolen, and to understand the conditions of 
the other party and the importance of preserving its 
coalition Government, while its occupation becomes 
more entrenched. We are exhausted by the additional 
tests that we must undergo to prove our efficiency, 
competence and eligibility to earn our natural, simple 
right to live a normal life; our inherent right to expect a 
stable and ordinary tomorrow and to dream about more 
beautiful days; and the right of our youth to plan their 
future safely with peace and freedom prevailing over 
our land, like other peoples of the world. The time has 
come for a genuine and ust peace to prevail in the land 
of peace. As I have said more than once, we are the only 
people in the world that remain under occupation.

All the Arab countries and ourselves have 
constantly warned about the disastrous consequences 
of the continuing Israeli colonial occupation and the 
denial of freedom and independence to the Palestinian 
people. We have repeatedly pointed out that allowing 
Israel to act as a State above the law without being held 
accountable or punished for its policies, aggression 
and defiance of the international community’s will 
and legality has provided fertile ground for, and an 
environment conducive to, the growth of extremism, 
hatred and terrorism in our region.

Confronting the terrorism that plagues our region 
by groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 
and others, which have no basis whatsoever in the 
tolerant Islamic religion or humanity, and whose 
members are committing vile and heinous atrocities, 
requires much more than military confrontation. The 
matter is of the utmost urgency and requires much 
more than condemnations and declarations of positions, 
which are of course necessary. What is needed, first and 
foremost, is a comprehensive, credible strategy to dry 
up the sources of terrorism and eradicate its roots in all 
political, intellectual, economic and social spheres in 
our region. It requires the creation of solid foundations 
for a practical consensus rendering the fight against 
all forms of terrorism everywhere a collective task to 
be undertaken by an alliance of peoples, nations and 
civilizations. It requires, as a priority, ending the Israeli 
occupation, that in its practices and perpetuation, 
constitutes an abhorrent form of State terrorism and a 
breeding ground for incitement, tension and hatred.

At a time when we are still suffering from the horrors 
of war, we face a formidable challenge to reconstruct 
what has been destroyed by occupation. This is the third 
time we are attempting to rebuild after the destruction 
inflicted on us by the occupation. We greatly appreciate 
the fact that next month, at the invitation of the Arab 
Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom of Norway, the city 
of Cairo will host an international conference on relief 
and reconstruction for the Gaza Strip. Our Government 
will present comprehensive reports to the conference 
on the losses the acts of aggression have inflicted on 
various sectors of society, and it will provide details 
of plans and programmes to be rapidly implemented 
in the Gaza Strip, aimed at meeting immediate relief 
needs and the requirements for reconstruction, in full 
coordination with and under the supervision of the 
relevant United Nations agencies and bodies.


Just a couple of days ago, the Palestinian faction 
emphasized its support for Gaza in order to facilitate 


reconstruction. While we reiterate our appreciation and 
gratitude to all the countries and organizations that 
hastened to help the Palestinian people both during 
and after the war, we are confident that brotherly and 
friendly countries will not waver in their support for 
the plans and programmes we will present, and that 
the conference will have practical results that can meet 
the expectations and needs of the victims of this act of 
aggression.

We reaffirm here that the chief prerequisite for 
the success of all these plans and efforts is an end 
to the despicable ongoing Israeli blockade that has 
suffocated the Gaza Strip for years and turned it into 
the largest prison in the world for nearly 2 million 
Palestinian citizens. At the same time, we affirm our 
commitment to and the importance of consolidating 
the ceasefire through the negotiations being conducted 
under the auspices of Egypt. However, in order to avoid 
a repetition of the cycle of war and reconstruction every 
two or three years, it is imperative that we focus on 
the fundamental issue and starting point, which is that 
Gaza’s suffering will never be completely over until 
the occupation is ended and the State of Palestine’s 
independence achieved.

During the past two weeks, Palestine and the Group 
of Arab States have been working intensively with the 
various regional groups in the United Nations to prepare 
for the introduction of a draft resolution on the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict for adoption by the Security Council 
and to advance efforts to achieve peace, which we still 
believe can be accomplished through international 
legitimacy. This endeavour reaffirms our commitment 
to achieving a just peace through a negotiated solution 
and a diplomatic and political effort through United 
Nations bodies. It is inspired by and based fully on the 
spirit and provisions of the many resolutions that have 
been adopted in the General Assembly and the Security 
Council, laying the foundations for a lasting solution 
and a just peace. There is nothing new here. All of these 
are previously adopted resolutions.

This endeavour hopes to correct the failure of 
previous efforts to achieve peace by affirming the 
goal of ending the Israeli occupation and achieving 
a two-State solution for the State of Palestine, with 
East Jerusalem as its capital, over the entire territory 
occupied in 1967, alongside the State of Israel, and with a 
just and agreed-on solution to the plight of the Palestine 
refugees on the basis of resolution 194 (III), with a 
specific time frame for implementing those objectives, 
as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative. There must 
be a time frame. That will be linked to the immediate 
resumption of negotiations between Palestine and Israel 
in order to demarcate the borders, reach a detailed and 
comprehensive agreement on all final status issues and 
then draft a comprehensive peace treaty between us and 
them.

We are confident that this endeavour will enjoy the 
full support of those who are committed to ensuring that 
our country will not witness new wars and atrocities, 
who wish to support a campaign to combat terrorism, 
who believe we must act expeditiously to rectify the 
historical injustice inflicted by the Nakba on the people 
of Palestine, and who wish to see peace prevail in the 
land of monotheistic religions. The adoption of that 
draft resolution will affirm that this year the Assembly 
is striving to realize the International Year of Solidarity 
with the Palestinian People, who will continue to be 
steadfast in their struggle and will rise brave and strong 
from the rubble of destruction. As our poet Mahmoud 
Darwish has said, we are infected with the incurable 
disease of hope, and we love life if we are given a 
chance at it.

There is an occupation that must end now. There is 
a people who must be freed immediately. The hour of 
independence of the State of Palestine has arrived, and 
I believe you are listening for it."
2,2018,"ISR_post_1998","When I spoke here three years ago (see A/70/PV.22), Israel stood alone among the nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this Hall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We opposed it because it threatens our future, even our very survival. We opposed it because the deal paved Iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal. By lifting the sanctions, it has fuelled Iran’s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie, that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
Israel exposed that lie earlier this year. In February 2018, Israel conducted a daring raid on Iran’s secret atomic archive. We obtained more than 100,000 documents and videos that had been stashed in vaults in an innocent-looking building in the heart of Tehran. In May, I presented a short summary of what we obtained to the international media. I provided hard evidence of Iran’s plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to deceive the international community. Israel shared that information and even more damning evidence that we found with members of the five plus one group and with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Months have passed, and the IAEA has still not taken any action. It has not posed a single question to Iran. It has not demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in that secret archive. Given that inaction,  I have decided, therefore, to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and with a few intelligence agencies. What I am about to say has not been shared publicly before. Today I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran’s secret nuclear-weapon programme.
In May, we exposed the site of Iran’s secret atomic archive. It is in the Shorabad district of Tehran. Today I am revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret atomic warehouse, which is located in the Torquzabad district of Tehran, just three miles away from the archive. Let me show exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. From this image, it looks just like the atomic archive, another innocent-looking compound. For listeners at home using Google Earth, this no-longer-secret atomic warehouse is on Mehr Alley. The coordinates are on the image. Anyone can try to get there. And for those who try to get there, it  is a hundred meters from the Kalishoi, a rug-cleaning operation. By the way, I hear they do a fantastic job of cleaning rugs there. But by now they may be radioactive rags. That is the second secret site.
Now countries with satellite capabilities may notice some increased activity on Mehr Alley in the days and weeks ahead. The people they will see scurrying back and forth are Iranian officials desperately trying to finish the job of cleaning up that site. Since we raided the atomic archive, they have been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month, they removed 15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel. What did they do with it? They had to get those 15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel out of the site, so they took it out and spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. The residents of Tehran, now endangered, may want to know that they can get a Geiger counter on Amazon for only $29.99. At today’s exchange rate, that is just 4 million Iranian rials. But we will get to that later. I will talk about the Iranian economy in a minute.
They took that radioactive material and spread it around Tehran. The Iranian officials cleaning out the site still have a lot of work to do, because they had at least 15 gigantic ship containers full of nuclear-related equipment  and  materiel  stored  there.  Since  each of
 
those containers can hold 20 tons of materiel, the site must have contained as much as 300 tons of nuclear- related equipment and materiel, all in that very place.
We now have to ask ourselves a question. Why did Iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse? After all, when South Africa and Libya gave up their nuclear programmes, the first thing they did was to destroy both the archives and the materiel and equipment. The answer to the question is simple. The reason Iran did not destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, it planned to use both of those sites in a few years when the time was right to break out the atom bomb. Delegations may rest assured that that will not happen. It will not happen because what Iran hides Israel will find.
I have a message for  the  Head  of  the  IAEA,  Mr. Yukiya Amano. I believe he is a good man. I believe he wants to do the right thing. I therefore ask him to do the right thing now. The IAEA should inspect that atomic warehouse immediately, before the Iranians finish clearing it out. Do delegations remember the time when we were promised that inspections could take place anytime, anywhere? Well, how about inspections of Mehr Alley right now? And while Mr. Amano is at it, he should inspect the other sites that we told him about. Once and for all, he should tell the world the truth about Iran.
I also have a message today for the tyrants of Tehran. Israel knows what they are doing, and Israel knows where they are doing it. Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction develop nuclear weapons — not now, not in 10 years, not ever. And Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran’s aggression. We will continue to act against it in Syria. We will act against it in Lebanon. We will act against it in Iraq. We will act against it whenever and wherever we must. We must act to defend our State and to defend our people.
Three years ago, a few weeks after the nuclear deal was completed, I asked this question from this very podium: does anyone seriously believe that flooding Iran’s radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? But many of the deal’s supporters believed just that. They believed that Iran’s regime would become more moderate, more peaceful. They believed that Iran would use the billions of dollars it received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of
its people — solving the water problem, the trucking problem, the electricity problem and improving hospitals and schools. That is what they believed. Perhaps some people here today also believed that.
Well, it did not happen. Instead, Iran used the money to fuel its vast war machine. Just this past year, Iran has attacked Kurds in Iraq, slaughtered Sunnis in Syria, armed Hizbullah in Lebanon, financed Hamas in Gaza, fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and threatened the freedom of navigation in the Strait  of  Hormuz and the Strait of Bab El-Mandeb. That is some peace, some moderation.
If people think that Iran’s aggression has been confined to the Middle East, they need to  think again. Last month, two Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks here in the United States, and several weeks ago, Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the heart of Europe. Yet while the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions.
Now, I have just used a tough word,  a  very  strong word: appeasement. I use it reluctantly. But unfortunately that is exactly what we are seeing again in Europe. We need to think about that. The same week that Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder European citizens, European leaders were rolling out the red carpet for President Rouhani, promising to give Iran even more money. As the son of a historian, I have to ask — and I ask it not merely as a historian’s son, but as a Jew, a citizen of the world and someone who has lived through the twentieth century — have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?
We in Israel do not need a wake-up call, because Iran threatens us every day. Despite the  best  of  hopes — and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal — that deal did not push war further away. It brought it ever closer to our borders. In Syria, Iran  is trying to establish permanent military bases against us and has already launched missiles and drones into our territory. In Gaza, Iran is arming terror groups to launch rocket attacks on our cities and terror attacks on our civilians. In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hizbullah in the building of secret sites for converting inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles that can hit targets deep inside Israel with an accuracy of within 10 metres.
 
The Assembly needs to listen to this. Hizbullah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields. It has placed three of these missile-conversion sites alongside Beirut’s international airport. I can show a picture that is worth a thousand missiles. In it, we can see Beirut’s international airport, the first missile site, which is in the Ouzai neighbourhood, on the water’s edge, a few blocks away from the runway. There is also a second site, which is underneath a soccer stadium, two blocks away, and a third site, which is adjacent to the airport itself, right next to it.
I therefore have a message for Hizbullah today. Israel also knows what it is doing. Israel knows where it is doing it. And Israel will not let it get away with it. Just as supporters of the nuclear deal were wrong about what would happen when sanctions were removed, they were dead wrong about what would happen when sanctions were restored. They argued that United States sanctions alone would have little economic impact on Iran. That is what they said. It is hard to believe.
Let us take a look at what  has  happened  to  Iran’s economy now that President Trump has forced companies to choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States, whose gross domestic product is 50 times the size of Iran’s gross domestic product. A year ago, Iran’s economy was booming. Now it is collapsing. Iran’s currency is plummeting. Inflation and unemployment are soaring. British airlines, German banks, French oil companies, Japanese oil importers and many others are scrambling to get out. If that is little economic impact, we can imagine what will happen with the next batch of United States sanctions, which will be imposed in November.
The deal’s supporters were also wrong when they argued — and it is hard to believe that they argued this, despite the fact that I have had many arguments with them — that restoring sanctions would rally the Iranian people around the regime. While they are definitely rallying, their rallying is definitely not around the regime. They are rallying against the regime. They are not chanting “Death to America”. They are chanting “Death to the dictator”. They are not chanting “Export the Islamic Revolution”. They are chanting “Leave Syria”, “Leave Lebanon”, “Leave Gaza”, and “Take care of us in Iran”.
I listen to those protests. I talk to Iranian people. I show videos and get so many responses — from Iranians. At first, I thought they were Iranian exiles — in the
safety of London or Paris or Los Angeles. No, these are Iranians from Iran, embracing Israel, criticizing their regime — that is an understatement — with their names. Shortly after the protests broke out, I asked my intelligence people, “What is going on?”
Those protests are an indicator of something extraordinary that has been taking  place there. Through those protests, the Iranian people are showing unbelievable courage. The protests are now embracing the whole of Iran — from the urban centres to distant villages, from the striking merchants in the bazaars to the young women  uncovering their hair.  The people of Iran are bravely standing up to a regime that has brutally repressed them for four decades and that has squandered — and still squanders — their money in bloody wars across the Middle East.
This is what I say to Europe’s leaders and to others. Instead of coddling Iran’s dictators, join the United States and Israel and most of  the Arab world  in supporting new sanctions against a regime that endangers all of us across the world.
Israel is deeply grateful to President Trump for his bold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. A great many of our Arab neighbours are also grateful. And everyone who cares about the peace and security of the world should also be grateful.
But I have an important confession to make. It  may be surprising, but I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence, an unintended but positive consequence. By empowering Iran, it has brought Israel and many Arab States closer than they have ever been before, in an intimacy and friendship that I have not seen in my lifetime and that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.
When friendships are formed around a threat or a challenge, opportunities are quickly seen, not just for security but for how to bring a better life to our peoples, which is what Israel can and wants to contribute to. Israel deeply values those new friendships, and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to expand peace, a formal peace, beyond Egypt and Jordan to other Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians. I look forward to working with President Trump and his peace team to achieve that goal.
I also want to take the opportunity now, here at the United Nations, a place I know something about because many years ago I served here as Ambassador
 
for many years, to express Israel’s appreciation to President Trump and Ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they have provided to Israel at  the United Nations. They have unequivocally backed Israel’s right to defend itself.  They rightly pulled out of a history-denying UNESCO and a morally bankrupt Human Rights Council. I think that more resolutions about Israel than about the rest of the world combined have been introduced in those bodies, and tenfold the number of resolutions on Iran, Syria or any other State. It is not even fair to say “tenfold”, because there are no multiples of zero.
President Trump and Ambassador Haley also stopped funding an unreformed United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it. Day after day, the Trump Administration has stood up to what has long been a specialty here at the United Nations, slandering Israel. Even though the shameful resolution 3379
(XXX) comparing Zionism to racism was repealed 25 years ago, I am sorry to say that its foul stench still clings to these halls.
Israel airlifted Ethiopian Jews to freedom and a new life in Israel, in the Jewish State. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is absurdly accused of racism. Israel’s Arab citizens vote in our elections, serve in our Parliament, preside over our courts and have exactly the same individual rights as all other Israeli citizens. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid. Today there are at least five times as many Palestinians as there were in 1948, the year of Israel’s founding. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. Do those here know what that is? It is the same old anti-Semitism with a brand-new face. That is all it is.
Once it was the Jewish people who were slandered and held to a different standard; today it is the Jewish State that is slandered and held to a different standard. Here is an example. Take the outlandish attacks that have been levelled against Israel after our Knesset, our Parliament, recently adopted a law declaring Israel the nation-State of the Jewish people. Nevertheless, Israel is a free country. People can oppose that law, and people have done so. People can call for different wording in this or that clause, or add or delete a clause. People can do that.
But when Israel is called racist for making  Hebrew its official language and the Star of  David  its national flag, when Israel is labelled an apartheid State for declaring itself the nation-State of the Jewish people — that is downright preposterous. And does the Assembly know why? Because represented in the Hall today are more than 100 countries that have only one official language, even though many other languages are commonly spoken within those countries. There are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags, even though they have many non-Muslims and non-Christians living in  their  midst. And there are dozens of countries that define themselves as nation-States of a particular people, even though there are many ethnic and national minorities within their borders. None of those countries have been denigrated or libelled for celebrating their unique national identity. Only Israel is denigrated. Only Israel is libelled. What is unique about the Jewish people is not that we have a nation-State. What is unique is that many still oppose our having a nation-State.
Moments ago, President Abbas outrageously said that Israel’s nation-State law proves that Israel is a racist, apartheid State. President Abbas should know better. He wrote a dissertation denying the Holocaust. His Palestinian National Authority imposes death sentences on Palestinians for selling land to Jews. Let me repeat that. If a Jew buys an apartment or a piece of land anywhere in the Palestinian territories, the Palestinian who sold  him that land is executed. That  is what the law says. President Abbas proudly pays Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews. In fact, the more they slay, the more he pays. That is in their law too. Then how can he condemn Israel’s morality and call Israel racist?
That is not the way to peace. That is not the way  to achieve the peace that we all want and need and to which Israel remains committed. This body should not be applauding the Head of a regime that pays terrorists. The United Nations should condemn such a despicable policy. And the United Nations, which brokered an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire in 2014, should demand that Hamas release our fallen soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. The latter was kidnapped when Hamas violated that very ceasefire. Hamas should also release the two Israeli citizens whom it holds captive, Avera Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed.
Every time I stand here I  feel  as  I  do  today.  I am privileged to stand here as the Prime Minister
 
of the State of Israel, a Jewish and democratic State. Some believe that Israel cannot be both Jewish and democratic. That is false. Israel is both, and Israel will always remain both. Ever since Abraham and Sarah made their journey to the promised land, nearly 4,000 years ago, the land of  Israel has been our homeland. It is the place where Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob, Leah and Rachel carried out their eternal covenant with God. It is where Joshua made us a sovereign nation, where David ruled and Isaiah preached, where the Maccabees fought and where Masada fell. It is the place from which we were exiled and to which we returned, rebuilding our ancient and eternal capital, Jerusalem. The nation-State of Israel is the only place where the Jewish people proudly exercise our collective right of self-determination. That right was recognized nearly a century ago by the League of Nations, and more than 70 years ago by the United Nations when it supported the establishment of a Jewish State. That is what resolution 181 (II) said, “a Jewish State”.
At the same time, Israel is a vibrant democracy, where all its citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, enjoy equal individual rights, and those rights are guaranteed by law. In Israel, whether a person is a Jew or an  Arab, a Christian or a Muslim, a Druze or a Bedouin or anything else, that person’s individual rights are exactly the same and will always  remain the same.  In the Middle East that is not obvious. Now that is an understatement. In the Middle East, where women are often treated as property, minorities are persecuted and gays are hanged, Israel stands out as a shining example of freedom and progress.
I could not be more proud to represent my country, Israel. I am proud that we have made Israel a global technological Power of breathtaking creativity in information technology and precision agriculture. Is the Assembly aware that we target the fertilizer and the water down to the individual plant — not to a field,  not to part of a field, but down to the plant? I am proud of those geniuses that have brought those unbelievable developments in water management, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, digital health, medical devices and so many other fields that are improving the lives of billions of people around the world. I am proud of Israel’s brilliant scholars, innovative entrepreneurs, talented artists, devoted teachers and compassionate doctors, and of our search-and-rescue teams who save lives from Haiti to Mexico, from Nepal to the Philippines. I am also proud of Israel’s courageous soldiers, the men
and women who bravely defend our homeland while upholding the highest values. Most of all, I am proud of the people of Israel, who draw extraordinary strength from the deep wellsprings of our heritage, who possess an unbreakable spirit and who are as determined as ever to build a secure and magnificent future for the one and only Jewish State."
2,2017,"ISR_post_1998","We are in the midst of a great revolution — a revolution in Israel’s standing among the nations. It is happening because so many countries around the world have finally woken up to what Israel can do for them. Those countries now recognize what brilliant investors like Warren Buffett and great companies like Google and Intel have recognized and known for years, that is, that Israel is the innovation nation, the place for cutting-edge technology in agriculture, in water, in cybersecurity, in medicine, in autonomous vehicles. You name it, we have got it.
Those countries now also recognize Israel’s exceptional capabilities in fighting terrorism. In recent years, Israel has provided intelligence that has prevented dozens of major terrorist attacks around the world. We have saved countless lives. Members may not know it, but their Governments do. And they are working closely together with Israel to keep their countries and its citizens safe.
I stood here last year, at this rostrum, and I spoke about that profound change in Israel’s standing around the world (see A/71/PV.14). Just look at what has happened since. In one year, hundreds of Presidents, Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and other leaders have visited Israel — many for the first time. Of those many visits, two were truly historic. In May, President Trump became the first American President to include Israel in his first visit abroad. President Trump stood at the Western Wall, at the foot of the Temple Mount, where the Jewish people’s temples stood for nearly 1,000 years. When the President touched those ancient stones, he touched our hearts forever.
In July, Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel. Some here may have seen the pictures. We were on a beach in Hadera. We rode together in a Jeep outfitted with a portable desalination device that some thriving Israeli entrepreneur invented. We took off our shoes, waded into the Mediterranean and drank seawater that had been purified only a few minutes earlier. We imagined the endless possibilities for Israel, for India and for all of humankind.
In the past year, Israel has hosted many world leaders. I had the honour of representing my country on six different continents in one year. I went to Africa, where I saw Israeli innovators increasing crop yields, turning air into water, fighting AIDS. I went to Asia, where we deepened our relations with China and Singapore, and expanded our cooperation with our Muslim friends in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. I went to Europe, where, in London and Paris, Thessaloniki and Budapest we enhanced our security and economic ties. I went to Australia, becoming the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit our great allies down under. And just last week, I went to South America, visiting Argentina and Colombia, and then I went on to Mexico — becoming, if members can believe it, the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Latin America. After 70 years, the world is embracing Israel, and Israel is embracing the world.
In one year, I visited six continents. It is true that I have not yet visited Antarctica, but I want to go there too, because I have heard that penguins are also enthusiastic supporters of Israel. Members laugh. But penguins have no difficulty recognizing that some things are black or white, are right or wrong. Unfortunately, when it comes to United Nations decisions about Israel, that simple recognition is too often absent. It was absent last December, when the Security Council adopted anti-Israel resolution 2334 (2016), which set back the cause of peace.
It was absent last May, when the World Health Organization — one has to listen to this — adopted a Syrian-sponsored draft resolution that criticized Israel for health conditions on the Golan Heights. As the great John McEnroe would say, “You cannot be serious!” That is preposterous. Syria has barrel-bombed, starved, gassed and murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens, and wounded millions more, while Israel has provided life-saving medical care to thousands of Syrian victims of that very same carnage. Yet who does the World Health Organization criticize? Israel.
Is there no limit to United Nations absurdities when it comes to Israel? Apparently not, because in July, UNESCO declared the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site. That is worse than fake news; that is fake history. While it is true that Abraham, the father of both Ishmael and Isaac, is buried there, so are Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca and Leah — who just happen to be patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people. Members will not read about that in the latest UNESCO report. But if members want to read about it, they can in a somewhat weightier publication. It is called the Bible. I highly recommend it. I hear it got four and a half out of five stars on Amazon, and it is a great read. I read it every week.
Let me now be serious. Despite the absurdities, despite the repetition of those farcical events, there is change. Slowly, but surely, there are signs of positive change — even at the United Nations. I very much appreciate the statement of the Secretary-General, indicating that denying Israel’s right to exist is anti-Semitism — pure and simple. That is important, because for too long the epicentre of global anti-semitism has been right here at the United Nations. And while it
may take many years, I am absolutely confident that the revolution of Israel’s ties with individual nations will ultimately be reflected here in this Hall of nations. I say that because there is also a marked change in the position of some of our key friends. Thanks to President Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel in this organ, that positive change is gathering force. I thank President Trump for supporting Israel at the United Nations, and I thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her support. I thank them for speaking the truth about Israel.
Here at the United Nations we must also speak the truth about Iran, as President Trump did so powerfully this morning. I served as Ambassador to the United Nations and I am a long-serving Israeli Prime Minister, so I have listened to countless speeches in this Hall. But I can say this — none were bolder, none were more courageous and forthright, than the one delivered by President Trump today. President Trump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran “an embarrassment”. I could not agree with that more. Here is why — Iran vows to destroy my country every day. That vow was repeated by its Chief of Staff the other day. Iran is conducting a campaign of conquest across the Middle East. And Iran is developing ballistic missiles to threaten the entire world.
Two years ago, I stood here and explained why the Iranian nuclear deal not only did not block Iran’s path to the bomb, but actually paved it. That is because the restrictions placed on Iran’s nuclear programme have what is called a “sunset clause”. Let me explain what that term means. It means that in a few years those restrictions will be automatically removed, not by a change in Iran’s behaviour, not by a lessening of its terror or its aggression, but merely by a change in the calendar. I warned that when that sunset came, a dark shadow would be cast over the entire Middle East and the world — because Iran would then be free to enrich uranium on an industrial scale, placing it on the threshold of a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons.
That is why I said two years ago that the greater danger was not that Iran would rush to a single bomb by breaking the deal, but that Iran would be able to build many bombs by keeping the deal. In the past few months we have all seen how dangerous even a few nuclear weapons can be in the hands of a small rogue regime. Imagine the danger of hundreds of nuclear weapons in the hands of a vast Iranian Islamist empire, with the missiles to deliver them anywhere on Earth. I know that there are those who still defend the dangerous deal with Iran, arguing that it will block Iran’s path to the bomb. That is exactly what they said about the nuclear deal with North Korea, and we all know how that turned out. Unfortunately, if nothing changes, this deal will turn out exactly the same way.
That is why Israel’s policy regarding the nuclear deal with Iran is very simple — change it or cancel it, fix it or nix it. Nixing the deal means restoring massive pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions, until Iran fully dismantles its nuclear-weapon capabilities. Fixing the deal requires many things, among them inspecting military sites and any other site that is suspect, and penalizing Iran for every violation. Above all, fixing the deal means getting rid of the sunset clause. Beyond fixing this bad deal, we must also stop Iran’s development of ballistic missiles and roll back its growing aggression in the region.
I remember we have had these debates. As members know, I took a fairly active role in them. Many supporters of the deal naively believed that it would somehow moderate Iran and make it a “responsible” member of the international community. I strongly disagreed. I warned that, when the sanctions on Iran would be removed, Iran would behave like a hungry tiger unleashed — not joining the community of nations, but devouring nations one after the other. That is precisely what Iran is doing today. From the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, from Tehran to Tartus, an Iranian curtain is descending across the Middle East. Iran spreads that curtain of tyranny and terror over Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. And it pledges to extinguish the light of Israel. Today I have a simple message for Ayatollah Khamenei, the dictator of Iran: the light of Israel will never be extinguished.
Those who threaten us with annihilation put themselves in mortal peril. Israel will defend itself with the full force of our arms and the full power of our convictions. We will act to prevent Iran from establishing permanent military bases in Syria for its air, sea and ground forces. We will act to prevent Iran from producing deadly weapons, in Syria or in Lebanon, for use against us. And we will act to prevent Iran from opening new terror fronts against Israel along our northern border. As long as Iran’s regime seeks the destruction of Israel, Iran will face no fiercer enemy than Israel.
But I also have a message today for the people of Iran, who are not our enemy. They are our friends. One day my Iranian friends will be free from the evil regime that terrorizes them, hangs gays, jails journalists, tortures political prisoners and shoots innocent women like Neda Soltani, leaving her choking on her own blood on the streets of Tehran. I have not forgotten Neda, and I am sure that neither have members. When the day of liberation for the people of Iran finally comes, the friendship between our two ancient peoples will surely flourish once again.
Israel knows that we are not alone in confronting the Iranian regime. We stand shoulder to shoulder with those in the Arab world who share our hopes for a brighter future. We have made peace with Jordan and Egypt, whose courageous President, Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, I met here last night. I appreciate President Al Sisi’s support for peace, and I hope to work closely with him and other leaders in the region to advance peace. Israel is committed to achieving peace with all of our Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians.
Yesterday President Trump and I discussed all of this at great length. I appreciate President Trump’s leadership, his commitment to stand by Israel’s side, his commitment to advance a peaceful future for all. Together, we can seize the opportunities for peace and together we can confront the great dangers of Iran. The remarkable alliance between the United States and Israel has never been stronger and never been deeper. Israel is deeply grateful for the support of the Trump Administration, the American Congress and the American people.
In this year of historic visits and historic anniversaries, Israel has much to be grateful for. A hundred and twenty years ago, Theodor Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress to transform our tragic past into a brilliant future by establishing the Jewish State. One hundred years ago, the Balfour Declaration advanced Herzl’s vision by recognizing the right of the Jewish people to a national home in our ancestral homeland. Seventy years ago, the United Nations further advanced that vision by adopting resolution 181 (II), supporting the establishment of a Jewish State. Fifty years ago, we reunited our eternal capital — Jerusalem — achieving a miraculous victory against those who sought to destroy our State. Theodor Herzl was our modern Moses, and his dream has come true. We have returned to the promised land, revived our language, ingathered our exiles and built a modern, thriving democracy.
Tomorrow evening Jews around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the beginning of our new year. It is a time of reflection, and we look back with wonder at the remarkable and miraculous rebirth of our nation. We look ahead with pride to the remarkable contributions Israel will continue to make to all nations. A simple look around will reveal those contributions every day — in the food people eat, the water they drink, the medicines they take, the cars they drive, the cell phones they use and in so many other ways that are transforming our world. It can be seen in the smile of an African mother in a remote village who, thanks to an Israeli innovation, no longer must walk eight hours a day to bring water to her children. It can be seen in the eyes of an Arab child who has flown to Israel to undergo a lifesaving heart operation. And it can be seen in the faces of the people in earthquake-stricken Haiti and Nepal, who are rescued from the rubble and given new life by Israeli doctors.
As the prophet Isaiah said: “I have made you a light unto the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the Earth.” Today, 2,700 years after Isaiah spoke those prophetic words, Israel is becoming a rising power among the nations. And, at long last, its light is shining across the continents, bringing hope and salvation to the ends of the Earth. Happy new year from Israel."
2,2014,"ISR_post_1998","I come here from 
Jerusalem to speak on behalf of my people, the people 
of Israel. I have come to speak about the dangers we 
face and about the opportunities we seek. I have come 
to expose the brazen lies spoken from this very rostrum 
about my country and the brave soldiers who defend it.

The people of Israel pray for peace, but our hopes 
for peace, and those of the world, are in danger, because 
everywhere we look militant Islam is on the march. It 
is not militants; it is not Islam; it is militant Islam, and 
typically, its first victims are other Muslims. But it 
spares no one. Christians, Jews, Yazidis, Kurds — no 
creed, no faith, no ethnic group is beyond its sights, 
and it is rapidly spreading in every part of the world. 
We know the famous American saying “All politics is 
local”. For the militant Islamists, all politics is global, 
because their ultimate goal is to dominate the world.

Now that threat might seem exaggerated to some, 
since it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a 
particular part of the body. But left unchecked, the 
cancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider 
areas. To protect the peace and security of the world, 
we must remove that cancer before it is too late. Last 
week, many of the countries represented here rightly 
applauded President Obama for leading the effort 
to confront the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham 
(ISIS); and yet weeks before, some of those same 
countries — the same countries that now support 
confronting ISIS — opposed Israel for confronting 
Hamas. Evidently, they do not understand that ISIS and 
Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree.

ISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed that they 
both seek to impose well beyond the territory under their 


control. Let us listen to what ISIS’s self-declared Caliph, 
Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, said two months ago. He said 
that the day would soon come when the Muslim would 
walk everywhere as a master, and that Muslims would 
cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of 
terrorism, and destroy the idol of democracy. Now let 
us listen to Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas. He 
proclaims a similar vision of the future. “We say this to 
the West”, he says. “By Allah it will be defeated, and 
tomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world”.

As its Charter makes clear, Hamas’s immediate 
goal is to destroy Israel; but it has a broader objective. 
It also wants a caliphate. Hamas shares the global 
ambitions of its fellow militant Islamists, and that is 
why its supporters cheered wildly in the streets of Gaza 
when thousands of Americans were murdered on 9/11. 
That is why its leaders condemned the United States 
for killing Osama Bin Laden, whom they praised as a 
holy warrior. When it comes to their ultimate goals, 
therefore, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.

And what they share in common, all militant 
Islamists share in common — Boko Haram in Nigeria, 
Al-Shabaab in Somalia, Hizbullah in Lebanon, Al-Nusra 
in Syria, the Al-Mahdi Army in Iraq and the Al-Qaida 
branches in Yemen, Libya, the Philippines, India and 
elsewhere. Some are radical Sunnis, some are radical 
Shiites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate 
from the seventh century. Others want to trigger the 
apocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century.

They operate in different lands. They target 
different victims. They even kill each other in their 
battle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic 
ideology. They all seek to create ever expanding 
enclaves of militant Islam, where there is no freedom 
and no tolerance, where women are treated as chattel, 
Christians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, 
and sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die. 
For them, anyone can be consider an infidel, including 
fellow Muslims.

Militant Islam’s ambition to dominate the world 
seems mad, but so too did the global ambitions of 
another fanatic ideology that swept into power eight 
decades ago. The Nazis believed in a master race. The 
militant Islamists believe in a master faith. They just 
disagree as to who among them will be the master of 
the master faith. That is what they truly disagree about. 
Therefore, the question before us is whether militant 
Islam will have the power to realize its unbridled 
ambitions.

There is one place where that could soon 
happen — the Islamic State of Iran. For 35 years, Iran 
has relentlessly pursued the global mission that was set 
forth by its founding ruler, Ayatollah Khomeini, with 
the following words:

“We will export our revolution to the entire world, 
until the cry ‘There is no God but Allah’ will echo 
throughout the world over”.
Ever since, the regime’s brutal enforcers, Iran’s 
Revolutionary Guards, have done exactly that. Let us 
listen to its current commander, General Mohammad 
Ali Jafari, who clearly stated that goal:
“Our Imam did not limit the Islamic Revolution to 
this country. Our duty is to prepare the way for an 
Islamic world Government.”
Iran’s president, Mr. Rouhani, stood here last 
week and shed crocodile tears over what he called the 
globalization of terrorism. Maybe he should spare us 
those phony tears and have a word instead with the 
commanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. He could 
ask them to call off Iran’s global terror campaign, 
which has included attacks in two dozen countries 
on five continents since 2011 alone. To say that Iran 
does not practice terrorism is like saying Derek Jeter 
never played shortstop for the New York Yankees. The 
bemoaning by the Iranian President of the spread of 
terrorism has got to be one of history’s greatest displays 
of double talk.

Some argue that Iran’s global terror campaign — its 
subversion of countries throughout the Middle East 
and well beyond the Middle East — is the work of the 
extremists. They say that things are changing. They 
point to last year’s election in Iran. They claim that 
Iran’s smooth-talking President and Foreign Minister 
have changed not only the tone of Iran’s foreign policy 
but also its substance. They believe that Rouhani and 
Zarif generally want to reconcile with the West, that 
they have abandoned the global mission of the Islamic 
Revolution. Really?

Let us look at what Foreign Minister Zarif wrote in 
his book just a few years ago:

“We have a fundamental problem with the West, 
and especially with America. This is because we 
are heirs to a global mission which is tied to our 
raison d’être”. 
A global mission which is tied to our very 
reason for being? Then Zarif asks a question — an 
interesting question, in my view. He says, “How come 
Malaysia” — referring to an overwhelmingly Muslim 
country — “does not have similar problems?” Then he 
answers: “Because Malaysia is not trying to change the 
international order”. That is our moderate.
Let us not be fooled by Iran’s manipulative charm 
offensive. It is designed for one purpose and one purpose 
only — to have the sanctions lifted and the obstacles to 
Iran’s path to the bomb removed. The Islamic Republic 
is now trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement 
that will remove the sanctions it still faces and leave it 
with the capacity of thousands of centrifuges to enrich 
uranium. That would effectively cement Iran’s place as 
a threshold military nuclear Power. In the future, at the 
time of its choosing, Iran, the world’s most dangerous 
regime, in the world’s most dangerous region, would 
obtain the world’s most dangerous weapons. Allowing 
that to happen would pose the gravest threat to us all.

It is one thing to confront militant Islamists on 
pickup trucks armed with Kalashnikov rifles. It is 
another thing to confront militant Islamists armed with 
weapons of mass destruction. I remember that last year 
everyone here was rightly concerned about the chemical 
weapons in Syria, including the possibility that they 
would fall into the hands of terrorists. Well, that did 
not happen, and President Obama deserves great 
credit for leading the diplomatic effort to dismantle 
virtually all of Syria’s chemical weapons capability. 
We can only imagine how much more dangerous 
the Islamic State — ISIS — would be if it possessed 
chemical weapons. Now, let us imagine how much 
more dangerous the Islamic State of Iran would be if it 
possessed nuclear weapons.

Would you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let 
ISIS build a heavy-water reactor? Would you let ISIS 
develop intercontinental ballistic missiles? Of course 
you would not. Then you must not let the Islamic 
State of Iran do those things either, because if you do, 
here is what will happen. Once Iran produces atomic 
bombs, all the charm and all the smiles will suddenly 
disappear — they will just vanish. It is then that the 
ayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their 
aggressive fanaticism on the entire world.

There is only one responsible course of action to 
address this threat. Iran’s nuclear military capabilities 
must be fully dismantled. Make no mistake — ISIS 
must be defeated, but to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as 
a threshold nuclear Power is to win the battle and lose 
the war.

The fight against militant Islam is indivisible. When 
militant Islam succeeds anywhere, it is emboldened 
everywhere. When it suffers a blow in one place, it is set 
back in every place. That is why Israel’s fight against 
Hamas is not just our fight; it is everyone’s fight. Israel is 
fighting a fanaticism today that other countries may be 
forced to fight tomorrow. For 50 days this past summer, 
Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, many of 
them supplied by Iran. I want members to think about 
what their countries would do if thousands of rockets 
were fired at their cities. Let them imagine millions 
of their citizens having seconds at most to scramble to 
bomb shelters, day after day. Members would not let 
terrorists fire rockets at their cities with impunity, nor 
would they let terrorists dig dozens of terror tunnels 
under their borders to infiltrate their towns in order to 
murder and kidnap their citizens. Israel justly defended 
itself against both rocket attacks and terror tunnels.

Yet Israel faced another challenge. We faced a 
propaganda war because, in an attempt to win the world’s 
sympathy, Hamas cynically used Palestinian civilians 
as human shields. It used schools — not just schools, 
United Nations schools — private homes, mosques 
and even hospitals to store and fire rockets at Israel. 
As Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers and 
at the tunnels, Palestinian civilians were tragically but 
unintentionally killed. There are heartrending images 
that resulted, and these fuelled libellous charges that 
Israel was deliberately targeting civilians. We were not. 
We deeply regret every single civilian casualty.

And the truth is, Israel was doing everything to 
minimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas was 
doing everything to maximize Israeli civilian casualties 
and Palestinian civilian casualties. Israel dropped 
flyers, made phone calls, sent text messages, broadcast 
warnings in Arabic on Palestinian television — all 
this to enable Palestinian civilians to evaluate targeted 
areas. No other country and no other army in history 
have gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among 
the civilian population of their enemies.

Such concern for Palestinian life was all the more 
remarkable given that Israeli civilians were being 

bombarded by rockets, day after day, night after 
night. And as their families were being rocketed by 
Hamas, Israel’s citizen army, the brave soldiers of 
the Israel Defense Forces, our young boys and girls, 
upheld the highest moral values of any army in the 
world. Israel’s soldiers deserve not condemnation 
but admiration — admiration from decent people 
everywhere.

Here is what Hamas did. Hamas embedded 
its missile batteries in residential areas and told 
Palestinians to ignore Israel’s warnings to leave. 
And just in case people did not get the message, they 
executed Palestinian civilians in Gaza who dared to 
protest. And, no less reprehensible, Hamas deliberately 
placed its rockets where Palestinian children live and 
play.

Let me show the Assembly a photograph. It was 
taken by a France 24 crew during the recent conflict. 
It shows two Hamas rocket launchers, which were used 
to attack us. Three children can be seen playing next to 
them. Hamas deliberately put its rockets in hundreds 
of residential areas like this — hundreds of them. That 
is a war crime. I say to President Abbas, these are the 
crimes — the war crimes — committed by his Hamas 
partners in the national unity Government which he 
heads and for which he is responsible. These are the 
real war crimes he should have investigated or spoken 
out against from this rostrum last week.

As Israel’s children huddle in bomb shelters and 
Israel’s Iron Dome missile defence knocked Hamas 
rockets out of the sky, the profound moral difference 
between Israel and Hamas could not have been clearer. 
Israel was using its missiles to protect its children; 
Hamas was using its children to protect its missiles.

By investigating Israel rather than Hamas for war 
crimes, the United Nations Human Rights Council has 
betrayed its noble mission to protect the innocent. In 
fact, what it is doing is to turn the laws of war upside 
down. Israel, which took unprecedented steps to 
minimize civilian casualties, is condemned; Hamas, 
which both targeted and hid behind civilians — that is a 
double war crime — is given a pass. The Human Rights 
Council is thus sending a clear message to terrorists 
everywhere: “Use civilians as a human shield. Use 
them again and again and again.” And you know why? 
Because, sadly, it works. By granting international 
legitimacy to the use of human shields, the Human 
Rights Council has become a terrorist rights council, 
and it will have repercussions — it probably already 
has — in terms of the use of civilians as human shields. 
It is not just our interests and values that are under 
attack: it is the interests and values of all of us.

We live in a world steeped in tyranny and terror, 
where gays are hanged from cranes in Tehran, political 
prisoners are executed in Gaza, young girls are abducted 
en masse in Nigeria and hundreds of thousands are 
butchered in Syria, Libya and Iraq, yet nearly half of 
the Human Rights Council’s resolutions focusing on a 
single country have been directed against Israel — the 
one true democracy in the Middle East; Israel, where 
issues are openly debated in a boisterous Parliament, 
where human rights are protected by independent 
courts, and where women, gays and minorities live in a 
genuinely free society.

The biased treatment of Israel by the Human Rights 
Council — that is a misnomer, but I will use it just the 
same — is only one manifestation of the return of one 
of the world’s oldest prejudices. We hear mobs today in 
Europe calling for the gassing of Jews. We hear some 
national leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is 
not a function of Israel’s policies; it is a function of 
diseased minds, and that disease has a name. It is called 
anti-Semitism. It is now spreading in polite society 
where it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel. 
For centuries, the Jewish people have been demonized 
with blood libels and charges of deicide. Today, the 
Jewish State is demonized with the apartheid libel and 
charges of genocide.

In what moral universe does genocide include 
warning the enemy civilian population to get out 
of harm’s way or ensuring that they receive tons of 
humanitarian aid each day, even as thousands of rockets 
are being fired at us, or setting up a field hospital 
to aid their wounded? I suppose it is the same moral 
universe in which a man who wrote a dissertation of 
lies about the Holocaust and who insists on a Palestine 
free of Jews — Judenrein — can stand at this rostrum 
and shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic 
cleansing. In the past, outrageous lies against the Jews 
were the precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our 
people. But no more; today, we the Jewish people have 
the power to defend ourselves. We will defend ourselves 
against our enemies on the battlefield and we will expose 
their lies against us in the court of public opinion. Israel 
will continue to stand proud and unbowed.

Despite the enormous challenges facing Israel, I 
believe we have a historic opportunity. After decades of 
seeing Israel as their enemy, leading States in the Arab 
world increasingly recognize that together we and they 
face many of the same dangers. Principally, that means 
a nuclear-armed Iran and militant Islamist movements 
gaining ground in the Sunni world. Our challenge is to 
transform those common interests in order to create a 
productive partnership that would build a more secure, 
peaceful and prosperous Middle East. Together we can 
strengthen regional security. We can advance projects 
in water, agriculture, transportation, health care, energy 
and so many other fields.

I believe that the partnership between us can also 
help facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Many have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian 
peace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement 
between Israel and the Arab world. But I believe that, 
these days, it may work the other way around, namely, 
that a broader rapprochement between Israel and the 
Arab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian 
peace. Therefore, to achieve that peace, we must look 
not only to Jerusalem and Ramallah but also to Cairo, 
Amman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere. I believe 
that peace could be realized with the active involvement 
of Arab countries that are willing to provide political, 
material and other indispensable support.

I am ready to make a historic compromise, and not 
because Israel occupies a foreign land. The people of 
Israel are not occupiers in the land of Israel. History, 
archaeology and common sense all make clear that we 
have had a singular attachment to this land for over 
3,000 years. I want peace because I want to create a 
better future for my people. But it must be a genuine 
peace, one that is anchored in mutual recognition and 
enduring security arrangements — rock-solid security 
arrangements — on the ground. Israel’s withdrawal 
from Lebanon and Gaza created two militant Islamic 
enclaves on our borders from which tens of thousands 
of rockets have been fired at Israel. Those sobering 
experiences heighten Israel’s security concerns 
regarding potential territorial concessions in the future.

Those security concerns are even greater today. Let 
us just look around. The Middle East is in chaos. States 
are disintegrating, and militant Islamists are filling 
the void. Israel cannot have territories from which it 
withdraws taken over by Islamic militants yet again, 
as happened in Gaza and Lebanon. That would place 
the likes of ISIS within mortar range, a few miles of 
80 per cent of our population. Think about that. The 
distance between the 1967 lines and the suburbs of 
Tel Aviv is similar to the distance between United 
Nations Headquarters and Times Square. Israel is a tiny 
country. That is why in any peace agreement, which 
will obviously necessitate a territorial compromise, I 
will always insist that Israel be able to defend itself, by 
itself, against any threat.

Yet despite everything that has happened, some still 
do not take Israel’s security concerns seriously, but I do 
and I always will. That is because as Prime Minister of 
Israel I am entrusted with the awesome responsibility 
of ensuring the future of the Jewish people and the 
future of the Jewish State. No matter what pressure is 
brought to bear, I will never waver in fulfilling that 
responsibility.

I believe that with a fresh approach on the part 
of our neighbours, we can advance peace despite the 
difficulties we face. In Israel, we have a record of making 
the impossible possible. We have made a desolate land 
flourish, and with very few natural resources we have 
used the fertile minds of our people to turn Israel into 
a global centre of technology and innovation. Peace 
would enable Israel to realize its full potential and to 
bring a promising future not only to our people and not 
only to the Palestinian people, but to many, many others 
in our region. But the old template for peace must be 
updated. It must take into account new realities and 
new roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbours.

There is a new Middle East. It presents new dangers 
but also new opportunities. Israel is prepared to work 
with Arab partners and the international community to 
confront those dangers and to seize those opportunities. 
Together, we must recognize the global threat of 
militant Islam, the primacy of dismantling Iran’s 
nuclear weapons capability, and the indispensable role 
of Arab States in advancing peace with the Palestinians. 
All that may fly in the face of conventional wisdom, but 
it is the truth. And the truth must always be spoken, 
especially in the United Nations. Isaiah, a great prophet 
of peace, taught us nearly 3,000 years ago in Jerusalem 
to speak truth to power. He said:

“For the sake of Zion, I will not be silent. For the 
sake of Jerusalem, I will not be still until her justice 
shines bright and her salvation glows like a flaming 
torch”.
Let us light a torch of truth and justice to safeguard 
our common future.
"
2,2015,"ISR_post_1998","I bring greetings from Jerusalem, the city in which the Jewish people’s hopes and prayers for peace for all of humanity have echoed throughout the ages.
Thirty-one years ago, as Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, I stood at this rostrum for the first time. I spoke that day against a draft resolution sponsored by Iran to expel Israel from the United Nations. Then, as now, the United Nations was obsessively hostile towards Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East. Then, as now, some sought to deny the one and only Jewish State a place among nations. I ended that first speech by saying, “Gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door” (A/39/PV.32, para. 83).
More than three decades later, as the Prime Minister of Israel, I am again privileged to speak from this rostrum. And for me, that privilege has always come with a moral responsibility to speak the truth. So after three days of listening to world leaders praise the nuclear deal with Iran, I begin my speech today by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, check your enthusiasm at the door”. The deal does not make peace more likely.
By fuelling Iran’s aggressions with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war more likely.
Just look at what Iran has done in the past six months alone, since the framework agreement was announced in Lausanne. Iran boosted its supply of devastating weapons to Syria. Iran sent more soldiers of its Revolutionary Guard into Syria. Iran sent thousands of Afghani and Pakistani Shiite fighters to Syria. Iran did all that to prop up Al-Assad’s brutal regime. Iran also shipped tons of weapons and ammunition to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, including another shipment just two days ago. Iran threatened to topple Jordan. Iran’s proxy, Hizbullah, smuggled into Lebanon SA-22 missiles to down our planes and Yakhont cruise missiles to sink our ships. Iran supplied Hizbullah with precision-guided surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones so it can accurately hit any target in Israel. Iran aided Hamas and Islamic Jihad in building armed drones in Gaza. Iran also made clear its plans to open two new terror fronts against Israel, promising to arm Palestinians in the West Bank and sending its Revolutionary Guard generals to the Golan Heights, from which its operatives recently fired rockets on northern Israel.
Israel will continue to respond forcefully to any attacks against it from Syria. Israel will continue to act to prevent the transfer of strategic weapons to Hizbullah from and through Syrian territory. Every few weeks, Iran and Hizbullah set up new terrorist cells in cities throughout the world. Three such cells were recently uncovered in Kuwait, Jordan and Cyprus. In May, security forces in Cyprus raided a Hizbullah agent’s apartment in the city of Larnaca. There they found five tons of ammonium nitrate — roughly the same amount of ammonium nitrate used to blow up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. And that was just in one apartment, in one city, in one country. But Iran is setting up dozens of terrorist cells like that around the world. They are setting up those terror cells in this hemisphere as well.
I repeat, Iran has been doing all of this — everything that I have just described — just within the past six months, when it was trying to convince the world to remove the sanctions. Just imagine what Iran will do after those sanctions are lifted. Unleashed and unmuzzled, Iran will go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey. In the wake of the nuclear deal, Iran is spending billions of dollars on weapons and satellites. Does anyone here think that Iran is doing that to

advance peace? Does anyone here think that hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts will turn that rapacious tiger into a kitten? People who think so should think again.
In 2013, President Rouhani began his so-called charm offensive here at the United Nations. Two years later, Iran is executing more political prisoners, escalating its regional aggression and rapidly expanding its global terror net. They say that actions speak louder than words, but, in Iran’s case, their words speak as loudly as their actions. Just listen to the Deputy Commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Qods Force. In February, he said that “the Islamic Revolution is not limited by geographic borders”. He boasted that Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Yemen are among the countries being “conquered by the Islamic Republic of Iran”. He said “conquered”.
For those here who believe that the deal in Vienna will bring about a change in Iran’s policy, listen to what Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, said five days after the nuclear deal was reached: “Our policies towards the arrogant Government of the United States will not change”. The United States, he vowed, will continue to be Iran’s enemy. While giving the mullahs more money is likely to fuel more repression inside Iran, it will definitely fuel more aggression outside Iran.
As the leader of a country defending itself every day against Iran’s growing aggression, I wish that I could take comfort in the claim that this deal blocks Iran’s path to nuclear weapons, but I cannot, because it does not. This deal does place several constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme, and rightly so, because the international community recognizes that Iran is particularly dangerous. But, here is the catch. Under this deal, if Iran does not change its behaviour — in fact, even if it becomes more dangerous in the years to come — the most important constraints will still be automatically lifted by year 10 and by year 15. That would place a militant Islamic terror regime weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. That just does not make any sense.
I have said that if Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country. This deal will treat Iran like a normal country even if it remains a dark theocracy that conquers its neighbours, sponsors terrorism worldwide and chants, “Death to Israel, death to America!” Does anyone seriously
believe that flooding a radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? Does anyone here really believe that a theocratic Iran with sharper claws and sharper fangs will be more likely to change its stripes? There is a general rule that I have learned — and that that those here must have learned it in their lifetime — which is that when bad behaviour is rewarded, it only gets worse.
I have long said that the greatest danger that the world faces is the coupling of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. I am gravely concerned that the nuclear deal with Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union. I know that some well-intentioned people sincerely believe that this deal is the best way to block Iran’s path to the bomb. However, one of history’s most important, yet least learned lessons, is that the best intentions do not prevent the worst outcomes. The vast majority of Israelis believe that this nuclear deal with Iran is a very bad deal. What makes matters even worse is that we see the world celebrating this bad deal, rushing to embrace and do business with a regime that is openly committed to our destruction.
Last week, Major General Salehi, the Commander of Iran’s Army, proclaimed
“We will annihilate Israel, for sure. We are glad that we are in the forefront of executing the Supreme Leader’s order to destroy Israel.”
As for the Supreme Leader himself, a few days after the nuclear deal was announced, he released his latest book. It is a 400-page screed detailing his plan to destroy the State of Israel. Last month, Khamenei once again made his genocidal intentions clear. Before Iran’s top clerical body, the Assembly of Experts, he spoke about Israel, which is home to over 6 million Jews. He pledged that “there will be no Israel in 25 years”. Seventy years after the murder of 6 million Jews, Iran’s rulers promise to destroy my country, murder my people, and the response from this body, the response from nearly every one of the Governments represented here, has been absolutely nothing — utter silence, deafening silence.
Perhaps members of the Assembly can now understand why Israel is not joining in the general celebration of the deal. If Iran’s rulers were working to destroy other members’ countries, perhaps they would be less enthusiastic about the deal. If Iran’s terror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at other members’ cities, perhaps they would be more measured in their praise. And if the deal were unleashing a nuclear
28/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
arms race in their neighbourhoods, perhaps they would be more reluctant to celebrate.
But no one should think that Iran is a danger only to Israel. Besides Iran’s aggression in the Middle East and its terror campaign around the world, Iran is also building intercontinental ballistic missiles whose sole purpose is to carry nuclear warheads. Now this fact needs to be remembered: Iran already has missiles that can reach Israel. So those intercontinental ballistic missiles that Iran is building are not meant for us. They are meant for others — for Europe, for America, for raining down mass destruction anytime, anywhere.
It is not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest Powers in the world. Believe me, it would be far easier to remain silent. But throughout our history, the Jewish people have learned the heavy price of silence. And as the Prime Minister of the Jewish State, as someone who knows that history, I refuse to be silent. I will say it again. The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies — those days are over. Not being passive means speaking up about those dangers. We have spoken up, we are speaking up, and we will continue to do so. Not being passive also means defending ourselves against those dangers. We have. We are. And we will.
Israel will not allow Iran to break in, to sneak in or to walk into the nuclear-weapons club. I know that preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons remains the official policy of the international community. But no one should question Israel’s determination to defend itself against those who seek our destruction. For in every generation, there have been those who sought to destroy our people. In antiquity, we faced destruction from the ancient empires of Babylon and Rome. In the Middle Ages, we faced inquisitions and expulsions. And in modern times, we faced pogroms and the Holocaust. Yet the Jewish people persevered.
And now another regime has arisen, swearing to destroy Israel. That regime would be wise to consider this fact: I stand here today representing Israel, a country that is 67 years young but is the nation State of a people nearly 4,000 years old. The empires of Babylon and Rome are not represented in this Hall of nations, nor is the 1,000-year Reich. Those seemingly invincible empires are long gone. But Israel lives. The people of Israel live.
The rebirth of Israel is a testament to the indomitable spirit of my people. For a hundred generations, the
Jewish people dreamed of returning to the land of Israel. Even in our darkest hours — and we had so many — even in our darkest hours, we never gave up hope of rebuilding our eternal capital, Jerusalem. The establishment of Israel made it possible to realize that dream. It has enabled us to live as a free people in our ancestral homeland. It has enabled us to embrace Jews who have come from the four corners of the Earth to find refuge from persecution. They have come from war-torn Europe, from Yemen, Iraq, and Morocco, from Ethiopia and the Soviet Union, from a hundred other lands. And today, as a rising tide of anti-Semitism once again sweeps across Europe and elsewhere, many Jews come to Israel to join us in building the Jewish future.
So here is my message to the rulers of Iran. Their plan to destroy Israel will fail. Israel will not permit any force on Earth to threaten its future. And here is my message to all the countries represented here. Whatever resolutions they may adopt in this building, whatever decisions they may take in their capitals, Israel will do whatever it must do to defend our State and to defend our people.
As the deal with Iran moves ahead, I hope it will be enforced — how can I put this? — with a little more rigour than was shown with the six Security Council resolutions that Iran has systematically violated and which now have been effectively discarded. I would call for ensuring that the inspectors actually inspect, that the snapback sanctions actually snap back, and that Iran’s violations not be swept under the Persian rug. There is one thing I can assure the Assembly of today that Israel will be watching closely.
What the international community now needs to do is clear: first, it must make Iran comply with all its nuclear obligations, and hold Iran’s feet to the fire. Secondly, Iran’s regional aggression must be put in check by supporting and strengthening those fighting Iran’s aggression, beginning with Israel. Thirdly, use sanctions and all the tools available to tear down Iran’s global terror network.
Israel is working closely with our Arab peace partners to address our common security challenges from Iran and also the security challenges from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and from others. We are also working with other States in the Middle East, as well as with countries in Africa, in Asia and beyond. Many in our region know that both Iran and ISIL are our common enemies. And when
15-29658 29/55

A/70/PV.22 01/10/2015
one’s enemies fight each other, one does not strengthen either one. One weakens both.
Common dangers are clearly bringing Israel and its Arab neighbours closer. As we work together to thwart the dangers that I have mentioned, I hope that we will build lasting partnerships for security, for prosperity and for peace. But in Israel, we never forget one thing. We never forget that Israel’s most important partner has always been, and will always be, the United States of America. The alliance between Israel and the United States is unshakeable.
President Obama and I agree on the need to keep arms out of the hands of Iran’s terror proxies. We agree on the need to stop Iran from destabilizing countries throughout the Middle East. Israel deeply appreciates President Obama’s willingness to bolster our security and to help Israel maintain its qualitative military edge in order to confront the enormous challenges we face. Israel is grateful that this sentiment is widely shared by the American people and its representatives in Congress — both by those who supported the deal and by those who opposed it.
President Obama and I have both said that our differences over the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family. But we have no disagreement about the need to work together to secure our common future. And what a great future it could be. Israel is uniquely poised to take advantage of the promise of the twenty-first century. Israel is a world leader in science and technology, in cybertechnology, software, water, agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and so many other fields that are being revolutionized by Israeli ingenuity and Israeli innovation. Israel is the innovation nation. Israeli know-how is everywhere. It is in our computers’ microprocessors and flash drives. It is in our smart phones, when we send instant messages and navigate our cars. It is on our farms, when we drip-irrigate our crops and keep our grains and produce fresh. It is in our universities, when we study Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in chemistry and economics. It is in our medicine cabinets, when we use drugs to treat Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. It is even on our plates, when we eat delicious cherry tomatoes. They were also perfected in Israel, in case someone did not know.
We are so proud in Israel of the long strides that our country has been able to take in a short time. We are so proud that our small country is making such a huge contribution to the entire world. Yet the dreams of
our people, enshrined for eternity by the great prophets of the Bible, will be fully realized only when there is peace.
As the Middle East descends into chaos, Israel’s peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan are two cornerstones of stability. Israel remains committed to achieving peace with the Palestinians as well. Israelis know the price of war. I know the price of war. I was nearly killed in battle. I lost many friends. I lost my beloved brother Yoni. Those who know the price of war can best appreciate what the blessings of peace would mean — for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. I am prepared to immediately resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority without any preconditions whatsoever. Unfortunately, President Abbas said yesterday that he is not prepared to do that. I hope he changes his mind, because I remain committed to a vision of two States for two peoples, in which a demilitarized Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State.
As members know, the peace process began over two decades ago. Yet despite the best efforts of six Israeli prime ministers — Rabin, Peres, Barak, Sharon, Olmert and myself — the Palestinians have consistently refused to end the conflict and to make a final peace with Israel. Unfortunately, we heard that rejectionism again only yesterday from President Abbas. How can Israel make peace with a Palestinian partner who refuses to even sit at the negotiating table? Israel expects the Palestinian Authority to abide by its commitments. The Palestinians should not walk away from peace. I would like to tell President Abbas that I know it is not easy. I know it is hard. But we owe it to our peoples to try, to continue to try. If we actually sit down together, if we actually negotiate and stop negotiating about the negotiation, and if we actually sit down to try to resolve the conflict between us, recognizing each other and not using a Palestinian State as a stepping stone for yet another Islamist dictatorship in the Middle East but as something that will live at peace next to the Jewish State, we can do remarkable things for our peoples.
The United Nations can help advance peace by supporting direct, unconditional negotiations between the parties. The United Nations will certainly not help advance peace by trying to impose solutions or by encouraging Palestinian rejectionism, And the United Nations should do one more thing. The United Nations should finally rid itself of its obsessive bashing of Israel. Here is just one absurd example of
30/55 15-29658

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22
that obsession. In the four years of horrific violence in Syria, more than a quarter of a million people have lost their lives. That is more than 10 times the number of Israelis and Palestinians combined who have lost their lives in a century of conflict between us. Yet last year, the Assembly adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and only one resolution about the savage slaughter in Syria. Talk about injustice. Talk about disproportionality. Count them: 20. And one against Syria. Well, frankly I am not surprised. To borrow a line from Yogi Berra, the late, great baseball player and part-time philosopher, when it comes to the annual bashing of Israel at the United Nations, it is déjà vu all over again.
Enough is enough. Today, 31 years after I stood here for the first time, I am still asking when the United Nations will finally check its anti-Israel fanaticism at the door, when the United Nations will finally stop slandering Israel as a threat to peace and when it will actually start helping Israel advance peace. The same question should be posed to Palestinian leaders. When will they start working with Israel to advance peace and reconciliation, stop libelling Israel and stop inciting hatred and violence?
Here is a good place for President Abbas to begin. He should stop spreading lies about Israel’s alleged intentions on the Temple Mount. Israel is fully committed to maintaining the status quo there. What President Abbas should be speaking out against are the actions of the militant Islamists who are smuggling explosives into the Al-Aqsa Mosque and who are trying to prevent Jews and Christians from visiting the holy sites. That is the real threat to those sacred sites.
A thousand years before the birth of Christianity, more than 1,500 years before the birth of Islam, King David made Jerusalem our capital, and King Solomon built the Temple on that Mount. Yet Israel will always respect the sacred shrines of all religions. In a region plagued by violence and by unimaginable intolerance, in which Islamic fanatics are destroying the ancient treasures of civilization, Israel stands out as a towering beacon of enlightenment and tolerance. Far from endangering the holy sites, Israel ensures their safety. Because, unlike the Powers that ruled Jerusalem in the past, Israel respects the holy sites and the freedom of worship of Jews, Muslims, Christians — everyone. And that will never change.
Because Israel will always stay true to its values. Those values are on display each and every day. They are on display when Israel’s feisty parliament
vigorously debates every issue under the sun; when Israel’s Chief Justice sits in her chair at our fiercely independent Supreme Court; when our Christian community continues to grow and thrive from year to year, whereas Christian communities elsewhere in the Middle East are decimated; when a brilliant young Israeli Muslim student gives her valedictorian address at one of our finest universities; and when Israeli doctors and nurses — doctors and nurses from the Israeli military — treat thousands of wounded from the killing fields of Syria and thousands more in the wake of natural disasters from Haiti to Nepal. That is the true face of Israel. Those are the values of Israel.
In the Middle East, those values are under savage assault by militant Islamists, who are forcing millions of terrified people to flee to distant shores. Just 10 miles from ISIS and a few hundred yards from Iran’s murderous proxies, Israel stands in the breach, proudly and courageously defending freedom and progress. Israel is civilization’s front line in the battle against barbarism. So here is a novel idea for the United Nations. Instead of continuing the shameful routine of bashing Israel, the international community should stand with Israel. The international community should stand with Israel as we work to check the fanaticism at its doors. It should stand with Israel as we prevent that fanaticism from even reaching its doors. The international community should stand with Israel because Israel is not just defending itself. More than ever, Israel is defending the world!"
2,2013,"ISR_post_1998","I feel deeply honoured and 
privileged to stand here before the General Assembly 
today representing the citizens of the State of Israel. 
We are an ancient people. We date back nearly 4,000 
years to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We have journeyed 
through time. We have overcome the greatest of 
adversities. And we re-established our sovereign State 
in our ancestral homeland, the land of Israel. The Jewish 
people’s odyssey through time has taught us two things: 
never give up hope and always remain vigilant. Hope 
charts the future, vigilance protects it.

Today our hope for the future is challenged by a 
nuclear-armed Iran that seeks our destruction. But I 
want members to know that that was not always the case. 
Some 2,500 years ago, the great Persian King Cyrus 
ended the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people. He 
issued a famous edict in which he proclaimed the right 
of the Jews to return to the land of Israel and rebuild the 
Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. That is a Persian decree, 
and thus began a historic friendship between the Jews 
and the Persians that lasted until modern times.

But, in 1979, a radical regime in Tehran tried to 
stamp out that friendship. As it was busy crushing 
the Iranian people’s hopes for democracy, it also led 
wild chants of “Death to the Jews!” Since that time, 
presidents of Iran have come and gone. Some presidents 
were considered moderates, others hard-liners. But 
they have all served that same unforgiving creed, that 
same unforgiving regime — that creed that is espoused 
and enforced by the real power in Iran, the dictator 
known in Iran as the Supreme Leader, first Ayatollah 
Khomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei.

President Rouhani, like the presidents who came 
before him, is a loyal servant of the regime. He was 
one of only six candidates the regime permitted to run 
for office. Nearly 700 other candidates were rejected. 
What made him acceptable? Rouhani headed Iran’s 
Supreme National Security Council from 1989 through 
2003. During that time, Iran’s henchmen gunned 
down opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant. They 
murdered 85 people at the Jewish community centre 
in Buenos Aires. They killed 19 American soldiers by 
blowing up the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Are we 
to believe that Rouhani, the national security adviser 
of Iran at the time, knew nothing about those attacks? 
Of course he did — just as 30 years ago Iran’s security 
chiefs knew about the bombings in Beirut that killed 
241 American marines and 58 French paratroopers.

Rouhani was also Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator 
between 2003 and 2005. He masterminded the strategy 
that enabled Iran to advance its nuclear-weapons 
programme behind a smokescreen of diplomatic 
engagement and very soothing rhetoric. I know that 
Rouhani does not sound like Ahmadinejad. But when it 
comes to Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme, the only 
difference between them is this: Ahmadinejad was a 
wolf in wolf’s clothing, Rouhani is a wolf in sheep’s 
clothing — a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over 
the eyes of the international community.

Like everyone else, I wish we could believe 
Rouhani’s words, but we must focus on Iran’s actions. 
And it is the brazen contrast — that extraordinary 
contradiction between Rouhani’s words and Iran’s 
actions — that is so startling. Rouhani stood at this very 
rostrum last week and praised Iranian democracy (see 
A/68/PV.6). Iranian democracy, he said. But the regime 
that he represents executes political dissidents by the 
hundreds and jails them by the thousands. Rouhani 
spoke of “the human tragedy in Syria”. Yet Iran directly 
participates in Al-Assad’s murder and massacre of tens 
of thousands of innocent men, women and children in 
Syria, and that regime is propping up a Syrian regime 
that just used chemical weapons against its own people. 
Rouhani condemned the “violent scourge” of terrorism. 
Yet in the past three years alone Iran has ordered, 
planned or perpetrated terrorist attacks in 25 cities 
on five continents. Rouhani denounced “attempts to 
change the regional balance through proxies”. Yet Iran 
is actively destabilizing Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain and 
many other Middle Eastern countries. Rouhani promises 
“constructive engagement with other countries”. Yet 
two years ago, Iranian agents tried to assassinate Saudi 
Arabia’s Ambassador in Washington, D.C. Just three 
weeks ago, an Iranian agent was arrested while trying 
to collect information for possible attacks against the 
American Embassy in Tel Aviv. Some constructive 
engagement!

I wish I could be moved by Rouhani’s invitation 
to join his “WAVE” — a world against violence and 
extremism. Yet the only waves Iran has generated in the 
past 30 years are waves of violence and terrorism that 
it has unleashed on the region and across the world. I 
wish I could believe Rouhani, but I do not because facts 
are stubborn things. The facts are that Iran’s savage 



record flatly contradicts Rouhani’s soothing rhetoric. 
Last Friday, Rouhani assured us that in pursuit of its 
nuclear programme, Iran had “never chosen deceit and 
secrecy.” Never chosen deceit and secrecy?

In 2002, Iran was caught red-handed secretly 
building an underground centrifuge facility at Natanz. 
In 2009, Iran was again caught red-handed secretly 
building a huge underground nuclear facility for 
uranium enrichment in a mountain near Qom. Rouhani 
tells us not to worry. He assures us that all that is not 
intended for nuclear weapons. Does any here believe 
that? If so, here are a few questions to ask.

Why would a country that claims to only want 
peaceful nuclear energy build hidden underground 
enrichment facilities? Why would a country with vast 
natural energy reserves invest billions in developing 
nuclear energy? Why would a country intent on merely 
having civilian nuclear programmes continue to defy 
multiple Security Council resolutions and incur the costs 
of crippling sanctions on its economy? And why would 
a country with a peaceful nuclear programme develop 
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) whose sole 
purpose is to deliver nuclear warheads? You do not build 
ICBMs to carry TNT thousands of miles away. You 
build them for one purpose: to carry nuclear warheads. 
Iran is now building ICBMs that the United States says 
could reach this city in three or four years.

Why would they do all that? The answer is simple. 
Iran is not building a peaceful nuclear programme. 
Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Last year alone, 
Iran enriched three tons of uranium to 3.5 per cent, 
doubled its stockpile of 20 per cent-enriched uranium 
and added thousands of new centrifuges, including 
advanced centrifuges. It also continued work on the 
heavy-water reactor in Arak in order to have another 
route to the bomb — a plutonium path. Since Rouhani’s 
election — and I stress this — that vast and feverish 
effort has continued unabated.

Underground nuclear facilities? Heavy water 
reactors? Advanced centrifuges? ICBMs? It is not that it 
is hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear-weapons 
programme; it is hard to find evidence that Iran does not 
have a nuclear-weapons programme. Last year, when 
I spoke here at the United Nations (see A/67/PV.12), I 
drew a red line. Iran has been very careful not to cross 
that line. But Iran is positioning itself to race across that 
line in future, at a time of its choosing. Iran wants to 
be in a position to rush forward to build nuclear bombs 
before the international community can detect it, much 
less prevent it. Yet Iran faces one big problem, and that 
problem is summed up in one word: sanctions.

I have argued for many years, including from 
this rostrum, that the only way to peacefully prevent 
Iran from developing nuclear weapons is to combine 
tough sanctions with a credible military threat. That 
policy is today bearing fruit. Thanks to the efforts of 
many countries, many represented here, and under the 
leadership of the United States, tough sanctions have 
taken a big bite out of Iran’s economy. Oil revenues 
have fallen. The currency has plummeted. Banks are 
hard pressed to transfer money. As a result, the regime 
is under intense pressure from the Iranian people to get 
the sanctions removed. That is why Rouhani got elected 
in the first place. That is why he launched his charm 
offensive. He definitely wants to get the sanctions 
lifted — I guarantee the Assembly that — but he does 
not want to give up Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme 
in return.

Here is the strategy to achieve that: first, smile a lot. 
Smiling never hurts. Secondly, pay lip service to peace, 
democracy and tolerance. Thirdly, offer meaningless 
concessions in exchange for lifting sanctions. Fourthly, 
and most important, ensure that Iran retains sufficient 
nuclear material and sufficient nuclear infrastructure 
to race to the bomb at a time that it chooses to do so. 
Why does Rouhani think he can get away with that? 
This is a ruse, a ploy. Why does Rouhani think he can 
get away with that? Because he has gotten away with it 
before. Because his strategy of talking a lot and doing 
little has worked for him in the past. He even brags 
about it. Here is what he said in his 2011 book about 
his time as Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator: “While 
we were talking to the Europeans in Tehran, we were 
installing equipment in Isfahan”. For those here who 
do not know, the Isfahan facility is an indispensable 
part of Iran’s nuclear-weapons programme. That is 
where uranium ore called yellowcake is converted into 
an enrichable form. Rouhani boasted: “By creating a 
calm environment, we were able to complete the work 
in Isfahan”. He fooled the world once; now he thinks 
he can fool it again. Rouhani thinks he can have his 
yellowcake and eat it too.

He has another reason to believe that he can get 
away with that, and that reason is called North Korea. 
Like Iran, North Korea also said its nuclear programme 
was for peaceful purposes. Like Iran, North Korea also 
offered meaningless concessions and empty promises 



in return for sanctions relief. In 2005, North Korea 
agreed to a deal that was celebrated the world over by 
many well-meaning people. Here is what a New York 
Times editorial had to say about it:

“For years now, foreign policy insiders have 
pointed to North Korea as the ultimate nightmare ... a 
closed, hostile and paranoid dictatorship with an 
aggressive nuclear-weapons programme. Very few 
could envision a successful outcome. And yet North 
Korea agreed in principle this week to dismantle its 
nuclear-weapons programme, return to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, abide by the Treaty’s 
safeguards and admit international inspectors.
“Diplomacy, it seems, does work after all.” 
(New York Times, 20 September 2005)
A year later, North Korea exploded its first nuclear-
weapon device.
Yet as dangerous as a nuclear-armed North Korea 
is, it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-
armed Iran. A nuclear-armed Iran would have a 
chokehold on the world’s main energy supplies. It would 
trigger nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle 
East, turning the most unstable part of the planet into 
a nuclear tinderbox. And for the first time in history, it 
would make the spectre of nuclear terrorism a clear and 
present danger.

A nuclear-armed Iran in the Middle East would 
not be another North Korea. It would be another 
50 North Koreas. I know that some in the international 
community think that I am exaggerating that threat. 
Sure, they know that Iran’s regime leads these chants: 
“Death to America!”, “Death to Israel!”. Then it 
pledges to wipe Israel off the map. But they think that 
wild rhetoric is just bluster for domestic consumption. 
Have those people learned nothing from history? The 
last century has taught us that, when a radical regime 
with global ambitions gets awesome power, sooner or 
later its appetite for aggression knows no bounds. That 
is the central lesson of the twentieth century. And we 
cannot forget it.

The world may have forgotten that lesson; the 
Jewish people have not. Iran’s fanaticism is not bluster. 
It is real. That fanatic regime must never be allowed to 
arm itself with nuclear weapons. I know that the world 
is weary of war. We in Israel know all too well the cost 
of war. But history has taught us that to prevent war 
tomorrow, we must be firm today.

That raises the question: Can diplomacy stop 
that threat? The only diplomatic solution that would 
work is one that fully dismantles Iran’s nuclear-
weapons programme and prevents it from having one 
in the future. President Obama rightly said that Iran’s 
conciliatory words must be matched by transparent, 
verifiable and meaningful action; and to be meaningful, 
a diplomatic solution would require Iran to do four 
things; first, cease all uranium enrichment, as called 
for by several Security Council resolutions; secondly, 
remove from Iran’s territory the stockpiles of enriched 
uranium; thirdly, dismantle the infrastructure for a 
nuclear-breakout capability, including the underground 
facility near Qom and the advanced centrifuges in 
Natanz; and, fourthly, stop all work at the heavy water-
reactor in Arak aimed at the production of plutonium. 
Those steps would put an end to Iran’s nuclear-weapons 
programme and eliminate its breakout capability.

There are those who would readily agree to leave 
Iran with a residual capability to enrich uranium. I 
advise them to pay close attention to what Rouhani said 
in a speech to Iran’s Supreme Cultural Revolutionary 
Council published in 2005. This is what he said:

“A country that can enrich uranium to about 3.5 per 
cent will also have the capability to enrich it to 
about 90 per cent. Having fuel-cycle capability 
virtually means that a country that possesses this 
capability is able to produce nuclear weapons.”
Precisely: that is why Iran’s nuclear-weapons 
programme must be fully and verifiably dismantled. 
That is why the pressure on Iran must continue. Here 
is what the international community must do. First, 
keep up the sanctions. If Iran advances its nuclear-
weapons programme during negotiations, strengthen 
the sanctions. Secondly, do not agree to a partial deal. 
A partial deal would lift the international sanctions 
that have taken years to put in place, in exchange for 
cosmetic concessions that will take only weeks for Iran 
to reverse. Thirdly, lift the sanctions only when Iran 
fully dismantles its nuclear-weapons programme.

The international community has Iran on the 
ropes. If it wants to knock out Iran’s nuclear-weapons 
programme peacefully, do not let up on the pressure. 
Keep it up. We all want to give diplomacy with Iran a 
chance to succeed. But when it comes to Iran, the greater 
the pressure, the greater the chance. Three decades 
ago, President Ronald Reagan famously advised “trust 
but verify”. When it comes to Iran’s nuclear-weapons 



programme, here is my advice: distrust, dismantle and 
verify.

Israel will never acquiesce to nuclear arms in the 
hands of a rogue regime that repeatedly promises to 
wipe us off the map. Against such a threat, Israel will 
have no choice but to defend itself. I want there to be 
no confusion on this point: Israel will not allow Iran to 
get nuclear weapons. If Israel is forced to stand alone, 
Israel will stand alone. Yet in standing alone, Israel will 
know that we will be defending many others.

The dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and the 
emergence of other threats in our region have led many 
of our Arab neighbours to finally recognize that Israel 
is not their enemy. That affords us the opportunity 
to overcome historic animosities and build new 
relationships, new friendships and new hopes. Israel 
welcomes engagement with the wider Arab world. We 
hope that our common interests and common challenges 
will help us forge a more peaceful future.

And Israel continues to seek a historic compromise 
with our Palestinian neighbours, one that ends our 
conflict once and for all. We want peace based on 
security and mutual recognition in which a demilitarized 
Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State of Israel.

I remain committed to achieving a historic 
reconciliation and building a better future for Israelis 
and Palestinians alike. I have no illusions about how 
difficult it will be to achieve. Twenty years ago, the 
peace process between Israel and the Palestinians began. 
Six Israeli Prime Ministers — myself included — have 
not succeeded in achieving peace with the Palestinians. 
My predecessors were prepared to make painful 
concessions. So am I.

But so far, Palestinian leaders have not been 
prepared to offer the painful concessions they must 
make in order to end the conflict. For peace to be 
achieved, the Palestinians must finally recognize 
the Jewish State and Israel’s security needs must be 
met. I am prepared to make a historic compromise 
for a genuine and enduring peace. But I will never 
compromise on the security of my people and of my 
country — the one and only Jewish State.

One cold day in the late nineteenth century, my 
grandfather, Nathan, and his younger brother, Judah, 
were standing in a railway station in the heart of Europe. 
They were seen by a group of anti-Semitic hoodlums, 
who ran towards them waving clubs, screaming, “Death 
to the Jews!” My grandfather shouted to his younger 
brother to flee and save himself. And he then stood 
alone against the raging mob to slow it down. They beat 
him senseless. They left him for dead. Before he passed 
out, covered in his own blood, he said to himself: 
“What a disgrace! What a disgrace! The descendants 
of the Maccabees lie in the mud, powerless to defend 
themselves.” He promised himself then that if he lived, 
he would take his family to the Jewish homeland and 
help to build a future for the Jewish people.

I stand here today as Israel’s Prime Minister because 
my grandfather kept that promise. So many other Israelis 
have a similar story: a parent or a grandparent who fled 
every conceivable oppression and went to Israel to start 
a new life in our ancient homeland. Together we have 
transformed a bludgeoned Jewish people, left for dead, 
into a vibrant, thriving nation, defending itself with the 
courage of modern Maccabees, developing limitless 
possibilities for the future.

In our time, the Biblical prophecies are being 
realized. As the prophet Amos said,

“They shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit 
them. They shall plant vineyards and drink their 
wine. They shall till gardens and eat their fruit. 
And I will plant them upon their soil never to be 
uprooted again.”
The people of Israel have come home, never to be 
uprooted again."
2,2016,"ISR_post_1998","What I am about to say is going to shock everyone — Israel has a bright future at the United Nations. I know that hearing that from me must surely come as a surprise, because year after year I have stood at this very rostrum and slammed the United Nations for its obsessive bias against Israel. And the United Nations has deserved every scathing word — for instance, for the disgrace of the General Assembly last year, which adopted 20 resolutions against the democratic State of Israel and a grand total of three resolutions against all the other countries on the planet. Israel, 20; the rest of the world, three.
And what about the joke called the United Nations Human Rights Council, which each year condemns Israel more than all the countries of the world combined? As women are being systematically raped, murdered and sold into slavery across the world, which is the only country that the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women chose to condemn this year? Yes, Israel. Israel, where women fly fighter jets, lead major corporations, head universities, preside — twice — over the Supreme Court, and have served as Speaker of the Knesset and Prime Minister. And that circus continues at UNESCO, the United Nations body charged with preserving world heritage. This is hard to believe, but UNESCO just denied the 4,000-year connection between the Jewish people and its holiest site, the Temple Mount. That is just as absurd as denying the connection between the Great Wall of China and China.
The United Nations, which began as a moral force, has become a moral farce. Therefore, when it comes to Israel at the United Nations, one might well think that nothing will ever change. Well, think again. Everything will change, and a lot sooner than one might think. The change will happen in this Hall, because back home Governments are rapidly changing their attitudes towards Israel. Sooner or later, that is going to change the way everyone votes on Israel at the United Nations.
More and more nations in Asia, in Africa and in Latin America see Israel as a potent partner in fighting the terrorism of today and in developing the technology of tomorrow. Today, Israel has diplomatic relations with over 160 countries, nearly double the number from when I served here as Israel’s Ambassador some 30 years ago. Those ties are getting broader and deeper every day. World leaders increasingly appreciate that Israel is a powerful country with one of the best intelligence services on Earth. Because of our unmatched experience and proven capabilities in fighting terrorism, many Governments will seek our help in keeping their countries safe.
Many also seek to benefit from Israel’s ingenuity in agriculture, in health, in water, in cybersecurity and in the fusion of big data, connectivity and artificial intelligence — that fusion that is changing our world in every way. Israel leads the world in recycling wastewater. We recycle about 90 per cent of our wastewater. How remarkable is that? Given that the next country on the list recycles only about 20 per cent of its wastewater, Israel is a global water Power. If we have a thirsty world, and we do, there is no better ally than Israel.
How about cybersecurity? That is an issue that affects everyone. Israel accounts for one tenth of 1 per cent of the world’s population, yet last year we attracted some 20 per cent of the global private investment in cybersecurity. If we digest that number, we see that Israel is punching a whopping 200 times above its weight. Therefore, Israel is also a global cybersecurity Power. If hackers are targeting banks, planes, power grids and just about everything else, Israel can offer indispensable help. Governments are changing their attitudes towards Israel because they know that Israel can help them protect, feed and improve the lives of their people.
This summer, I had an unbelievable opportunity to see that change vividly during an unforgettable visit to four African countries. That was the first visit to Africa by an Israeli Prime Minister in decades. Later today, I will be meeting with leaders from 17 African countries. We will discuss how Israeli technology can help them in their efforts to transform their countries. In Africa, things are changing. In China, India, Russia and Japan, attitudes towards Israel have changed as well. Those powerful nations know that, despite Israel’s small size, it can make a big difference in many areas that are important to them.
But now I am going to surprise everyone even more. The biggest changes in attitudes towards Israel is taking place elsewhere. It is taking place in the Arab world. Our peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan continue to be anchors of stability in the volatile Middle East. For the first time in my lifetime, many other States in the region recognize that Israel is not their enemy. They recognize that Israel is their ally. Our common enemies are Iran and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Our common goals are security, prosperity and peace.
I believe that, in the years ahead, we will work together to achieve those goals, work together openly. Therefore, Israel’s diplomatic relations are undergoing nothing less than a revolution. But in that revolution we never forget that our cherished alliance, our deepest friendship, is with the United States of America, the powerful and the most generous nation on Earth. Our unbreakable bond with the United States of America transcends parties and politics. It reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support for Israel among the American people, support which is at record highs and for which we are deeply grateful.
The United Nations denounces Israel; the United States supports Israel. And a central pillar of that defence has been America’s consistent support for Israel at the United Nations. I appreciate President Obama’s commitment to that long-standing United States policy. In fact, the only time that the United States cast a Security Council veto during the Obama presidency was against an anti-Israel draft resolution in 2011 (see S/PV.6484). As President Obama rightly declared at this rostrum, peace will not come from statements and resolutions at the United Nations. I believe the day is not far off when Israel will be able to rely on many countries to stand with us at the United Nations. Slowly but surely, the days when United Nations Ambassadors reflexively condemn Israel are coming to an end.
Today’s automatic majority against Israel at the United Nations reminds me of the incredible story of Hiroo Onada, who was a Japanese soldier sent to the Philippines in 1944. He lived in the jungle. He scavenged for food. He evaded capture. Eventually he surrendered, but that did not happen until 1974, some 30 years after the end of the Second World War. For decades, Hiroo refused to believe the war was over. As Hiroo was hiding in the jungle, Japanese tourists were swimming in pools in American luxury hotels in nearby Manila. Finally, mercifully, Hiroo’s former commanding officer was sent to persuade him to come out of hiding. Only then did Hiroo lay down his arms.
I have one message for those present here today, that is, that they too should lay down their arms. The war against Israel at the United Nations is over. Perhaps some of those present do not know it yet, but I am confident that one day in the not too distant future they will also get the message from their leaders informing them that the war against Israel at the United Nations has ended. Yes, I know, there might be a storm before the calm. I know there is talk about ganging up on Israel at the United Nations later this year.
Given the United Nations history of hostility towards Israel, does anyone really believe that Israel will let the United Nations determine our security and our vital national interests? We will not accept any attempt by the United Nations to dictate terms to Israel. The road to peace runs through Jerusalem and Ramallah, not through New York. But regardless of what happens in the months ahead, I have total confidence that, in the years ahead, the revolution in Israel’s standing among the nations will finally penetrate this Hall of nations.
I have so much confidence, in fact, that I predict that a decade from now an Israeli Prime Minister will stand right here where I am standing and actually applaud the United Nations. But I want to ask: why do we have to wait a decade? Why keep vilifying Israel? Perhaps because some do not appreciate that the obsessive bias against Israel is not just a problem for my country, it is a problem for the other countries too. If the United Nations spends so much time condemning the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, it has far less time to address war, disease, poverty, climate change and all of the other serious problems that plague the planet.
Are the half-million slaughtered Syrians helped by Member States’ condemnation of Israel? The same Israel that has treated thousands of injured Syrians in our hospitals, including a field hospital that I built right along the Golan Heights border with Syria. Are the gays hanging from cranes in Iran helped by acts to denigrate Israel? That same Israel where gays march proudly in our streets and serve in our Parliament, including, I am proud to say, in my own Likud party. The starving children in North Korea’s brutal tyranny, are they helped by the demonization of Israel? Israel, whose agricultural know-how is feeding the hungry throughout the developing world? The sooner the United Nations obsession with Israel ends, the better — the better for Israel, the better for other countries, the better for the United Nations itself.
If United Nations habits die hard, Palestinian habits die even harder. President Abbas just attacked, from this rostrum, the Balfour Declaration. He is preparing a lawsuit against Britain for that declaration from 1917. That is almost 100 years ago — talk about being stuck in the past. The Palestinians may just as well sue Iran for the Cyrus Declaration, which enabled the Jews to rebuild our Temple in Jerusalem 2,500 years ago. Come to think of it, why not a Palestinian class action suit against Abraham for buying that plot of land in Hebron where the fathers and mothers of the Jewish people were buried 4,000 years ago? It is as absurd as that. To sue the British Government for the Balfour Declaration? Is he kidding? And that is taken seriously here?
President Abbas attacked the Balfour Declaration because it recognized the right of the Jewish people to a national home in the land of Israel. When the United Nations supported the establishment of a Jewish State in 1947, it recognized our historical and our moral rights to our homeland. Yet today, nearly 70 years later, the Palestinians still refuse to recognize those rights — not our right to a homeland, not our right to a State, not our right to anything. And that remains the true core of the conflict: the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish State in any boundary. One can see that the conflict is not about the settlements. It never was.
The conflict raged for decades before there was a single settlement, when Judea, Samaria and Gaza were all in Arab hands. The West Bank and Gaza were in Arab hands, and they attacked us again and again and again. And when we uprooted all 21 settlements in Gaza and withdrew from every last inch of Gaza, we did not get peace from Gaza — we got thousands of rockets fired at us from Gaza.
The conflict rages because for the Palestinians the real settlements they are after are Haifa, Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Keep in mind, the issue of settlements is a real one, and it can and must be resolved in final-status negotiations. But this conflict has never been about the settlements, nor about establishing a Palestinian State. It has always been about the existence of a Jewish State, a Jewish State within any boundaries. Israel is ready, as am I, to negotiate all final-status issues. However, one thing I will never negotiate is our right to our State, the one and only Jewish State. Change may be coming sooner than I thought.
Had the Palestinians said yes to a Jewish State in 1947, there would have been no war, no refugees and no conflict. When the Palestinians finally say yes to a Jewish State, we will be able to end our conflict once and for all.
The real tragedy is that the Palestinians are not only trapped in the past, but their leaders are poisoning the future. By way of illustration, I want the Assembly to imagine a day in the life of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy named Ali. Ali wakes up before school and goes to soccer practice with a team named after Dalal Mughrabi, a Palestinian terrorist responsible for the murder of a busload of 37 Israelis. At school, Ali attends an event sponsored by the Palestinian Ministry of Education honouring Baha Alyan, who last year murdered three Israeli civilians.
On his walk home, Ali looks up at a towering statue erected just a few weeks ago by the Palestinian authorities to honour Abu Sukar, who detonated a bomb in the centre of Jerusalem, killing 15 Israelis. When Ali gets home, he turns on the television and sees an interview with a senior Palestinian official, Jibril Rajoub, who says that, if he had a nuclear bomb, he would have detonated it over Israel that very morning.
Ali then turns on the radio, and he hears President Abbas’ adviser Sultan Abu al-Einein urging Palestinians to “slit the throats of Israelis wherever you find them”. Ali checks his Facebook, and he sees a recent post by President Abbas’ Fatah party, calling the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 a “heroic act”. On YouTube, Ali watches a clip of President Abbas himself saying “we welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem”.
Over dinner, Ali asks his mother what would happen if he killed a Jew and went to an Israeli prison. She tells him that he would be paid thousands of dollars each month by the Palestinian authorities. In fact, she tells him that the more Jews he killed, the more money he would get. When he gets out of prison, Ali would be guaranteed a job with the Palestinian authorities.
All of that is not just a story, it is real. It happens every day, all the time. Sadly, Ali represents hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children who are indoctrinated with hate during every moment of every hour. That is child abuse. Imagine if it were our children undergoing such brainwashing. Imagine what it takes for a young boy or girl to break free of such a culture of hate. Some do, but far too many do not.
How can any of us expect young Palestinians to support peace when their leaders poison their minds against peace? In Israel we do not do that; we educate our children for peace. In fact, my Government recently launched a pilot programme to make the study of Arabic mandatory for Jewish children, so that we can better understand each other, and so that we can live together side by side, in peace. Of course, like all societies, Israel has fringe elements. But it is our response to those fringe elements that makes all the difference.
Let us consider the tragic case of Ahmed Dawabsha. I shall never forget visiting Ahmed in the hospital, just hours after he was attacked. This little boy — a baby — was badly burned. Ahmed was the victim of a horrible terrorist attack perpetrated by Jews. He lay bandaged and unconscious as Israeli doctors worked around the clock to save him. No words could bring comfort to this boy or to his family. Nevertheless, as I stood by his bedside, I told his uncle: “This is not our people. This is not our way”. I then ordered extraordinary measures to bring Ahmed’s assailants to justice, and today the Jewish citizens of Israel accused of attacking the Dawabsha family are in jail awaiting trial.
For some, that story shows that both sides have their extremists and that both sides are equally responsible for our seemingly endless conflict. However, what Ahmed’s story actually proves is the very opposite. It illustrates the profound difference between our two societies. While Israeli leaders condemn terrorists — Arabs and Jews alike — Palestinian leaders celebrate terrorists. While Israel jails the handful of Jewish terrorists among us, the Palestinians pay thousands of terrorists among them.
I therefore call upon President Abbas to tell him that he has a choice to make. He can continue to stoke hatred, as he did today, or he can finally confront hatred and work with me to establish peace between our two peoples. I know that many of you have given up on peace, but I want it to be known that I have not given up on peace.
I remain committed to a vision of peace based on two States, for two peoples. I believe, more than ever before, that changes taking place in the Arab world today offer a unique opportunity to advance that peace. In that connection, I commend President Al Sisi of Egypt for his efforts to advance peace and stability in our region.
Israel welcomes the spirit of the Arab Peace Initiative and welcomes a dialogue with Arab States to advance a broader peace. I believe that, in order for that broader peace to be fully achieved, the Palestinians have to be part of it. I am ready to begin negotiations to achieve that today without any further delay.
Although President Abbas spoke here an hour ago, would it not be better if, instead of speaking past each other, we were speaking to one another? I invite President Abbas to speak to the Israeli people at the Knesset in Jerusalem, instead of railing against Israel at the United Nations in New York. I would gladly come to speak to the Palestinian Parliament in Ramallah.
While Israel seeks peace with all our neighbours, we also know that peace has no greater enemy than the forces of militant Islam. The bloody trail of such fanaticism runs through all the continents represented here. It runs through Paris and Nice, Brussels and Baghdad, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Minnesota and New York. From Sydney to San Bernadino, so many have suffered its savagery: Christians and Jews, women and gays, Yazidis and Kurds and many others.
Yet the heaviest price of all has been paid by innocent Muslims — hundreds of thousands mercilessly slaughtered, millions turned into desperate refugees, tens of millions brutally subjugated. The defeat of militant Islam will therefore be a victory for all humankind. It will especially be a victory for the many Muslims who seek a life without fear — a life of peace, a life of hope.
To defeat the forces of militant Islam, we must fight them relentlessly. We must fight them in the real world. We must fight them in the virtual world. We must dismantle their networks, disrupt their funding channels and discredit their ideology. We can defeat them, and we will defeat them. Medievalism is no match for modernity. Hope is stronger than hate. Freedom is mightier than fear. We can do it.
Israel fights the fateful battle against the forces of militant Islam every day. We keep our borders safe from the Islamic State. We prevent the smuggling of game-changing weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon. We foil Palestinian terror attacks in the West Bank. We deter missile attacks from Hamas-controlled Gaza.
That is the same Hamas terror organization that cruelly — unbelievably cruelly — refuses to return three of our citizens and the bodies of our fallen soldiers, Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. Hadar Goldin’s parents, Leah and Simcha Goldin, are here with us today. They have one request: to be able to bury their beloved son in Israel. All they ask for is one simple thing: to be able to visit the grave of their fallen son, Hadar, in Israel, but Hamas refuses. Hamas could not care less. I implore everyone to stand with Hadar’s parents, with us, with all that is decent in our world against the inhumanity of Hamas, which represents all that is indecent and barbaric. Hamas breaks every humanitarian rule in the book. Throw the book at them.
The greatest threat to my country, to our region and ultimately to our world remains the militant Islamic regime of Iran. Iran openly seeks Israel’s annihilation. It threatens countries across the Middle East. It sponsors terror worldwide. This year, Iran has fired ballistic missiles in direct defiance of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). It has expanded its activities in Iraq, Syria and in Yemen. Iran, the world’s foremost sponsor of terrorism, continues to build its global terror network. That terror network now spans five continents. My point is as follows: the threat that Iran poses to all of us is not behind us; it is in front of us. In the coming years, there must be a sustained and united effort to push back against Iran’s aggression and terror. With the nuclear constraints on Iran one year closer to being removed, let me be clear: Israel will not allow the terrorist regime in Iran to develop nuclear weapons — not now, not in a decade, not ever.
I stand before the Assembly at a time when Israel’s former President Shimon Peres is fighting for his life. Shimon is one of Israel’s founding fathers, one of its boldest statesman and one of its most respected leaders. I know that the Assembly will join me and the people of Israel in wishing him a speedy recovery. I have always admired Shimon’s boundless optimism. Like him, I am filled with hope.
I am filled with hope because Israel is capable of defending itself by itself against any threat. I am filled with hope because the valour of our fighting men and women is second to none. I am filled with hope because I know that the forces of civilization will ultimately triumph over the forces of terror. I am filled with hope because in the age of innovation, Israel, the innovation nation, is thriving like never before. I am filled with hope because Israel works tirelessly to advance equality and opportunity for all its citizens: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, everyone. I am filled with hope because despite all the doubters, I believe that in the years ahead Israel will forge a lasting peace with all our neighbours.
I am hopeful about what Israel can accomplish because I have seen what Israel has accomplished. In 1948, the year of Israel’s independence, our population was 800,000. Our main export was oranges. People said that we were too small, too weak, too isolated and too demographically outnumbered to survive, let alone thrive. The sceptics were wrong about Israel then, and the sceptics are wrong about Israel now. Israel’s population has grown tenfold. Our economy has grown fortyfold. Today, our biggest export is technology. Israeli technology powers the world’s computers, cell phones, cars and so much more.
The future belongs to those who innovate, and that is why the future belongs to countries like Israel. Israel wants to form partnerships in seizing that future, and so I call on all those present to embrace Israel, to cooperate and dream with Israel. Dream of the future that we can build together — a future of breathtaking progress, a future of security, prosperity and peace, a future of hope for all humankind, a future where even at the United Nations, even in this Hall, Israel will finally, inevitably, take its rightful place among the nations."
2,2012,"ISR_post_1998","It is a pleasure to see the
General Assembly presided over by the Ambassador from Israel, and it is good to see all of the representatives
here.
Three thousand years ago, King David reigned
over the Jewish State in our eternal capital, Jerusalem.
I say that to all those who proclaim that the Jewish
State has no roots in our region and that it will soon
disappear. Throughout our history, the Jewish people
have overcome all the tyrants who have sought our
destruction. It is their ideologies that have been
discarded by history. The people of Israel live on. We
say in Hebrew, the Jewish State will live forever.
The Jewish people have lived in the land of Israel
for thousands of years. Even after most of our people
were exiled from it, Jews continued to live in the land
of Israel throughout the ages. The masses of our people
never gave up the dream of returning to our ancient
homeland. Defying the laws of history, we did just that.
We ingathered the exiles, restored our independence
and rebuilt our national life. The Jewish people have
come home. We will never be uprooted again.
Yesterday was Yom Kippur, the holiest day of
the Jewish year. Every year, for over three millennia,
we have come together on this day of ref lection and
atonement. We take stock of our past. We pray for our
future. We remember the sorrows of our persecution;
we remember the great travails of our dispersion; we
mourn the extermination of a third of our people,
6 million, in the Holocaust.
But at the end of Yom Kippur, we celebrate. We
celebrate the rebirth of Israel. We celebrate the heroism
of our young men and women who have defended our
people with the indomitable courage of Joshua, David
and the Maccabees of old. We celebrate the marvel
of the flourishing modern Jewish State. In Israel we
walk the same paths as those trodden by our patriarchs
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But we blaze new trails in
science, technology, medicine and agriculture. In Israel
the past and the future find common ground.
Unfortunately, that is not the case in many other
countries. For today, a great battle is being waged
between the modern and the medieval. The forces of
modernity seek a bright future in which the rights of
all are protected, in which an ever-expanding digital
library is available in the palm of every child, in which
every life is sacred.
The forces of medievalism seek a world in which
women and minorities are subjugated, in which knowledge is suppressed, in which not life but death
is glorified. Those forces clash around the globe, but
nowhere more starkly than in the Middle East. Israel
stands proudly with the forces of modernity. We protect
the rights of all our citizens, men and women, Jews and
Arabs, Muslims and Christians — all are equal before
the law.
Israel is also making the world a better place. Our
scientists win Nobel Prizes. Our know-how is in every
cell phone and computer that every one of us uses. We
prevent hunger by irrigating arid lands in Africa and
Asia. Recently, I was deeply moved when I visited
Technion, one of our technological institutes in Haifa,
and I saw a man paralysed from the waist down climb
up a f light of stairs, quite easily, with the aid of an
Israeli invention. And Israel’s exceptional creativity is
matched by our people’s remarkable compassion. When
disaster strikes anywhere in the world — in Haiti,
Japan, India, Turkey, Indonesia and elsewhere — Israeli
doctors are among the first on the scene, performing
lifesaving surgeries.
In the past year, I lost both my father and my
father-in-law. In the same hospital wards where they
were treated, Israeli doctors were treating Palestinian
Arabs. In fact, every year, thousands of Arabs from
the Palestinian territories and Arabs from throughout
the Middle East come to Israel to be treated in Israeli
hospitals by Israeli doctors. I know that that is not
going to be spoken by speakers at this podium, but it
is the truth. It is important that the world be aware of
that truth. It is because Israel cherishes life that Israel
cherishes peace and seeks peace. We seek to preserve
our historic ties and our historic peace treaties with
Egypt and Jordan. We seek to forge a durable peace
with the Palestinians.
President Abbas just spoke here. I say to him and
I say to the Assembly: we will not solve our conflict
with libellous speeches at the United Nations. That is
not the way to solve it. We will not solve our conflict
with unilateral declarations of statehood. We have
to sit together, negotiate together and reach a mutual
compromise, in which a demilitarized Palestinian State
recognizes the one and only Jewish State.
Israel wants to see a Middle East of progress and
peace. We want to see the three great religions that
sprang forth from our region — Judaism, Christianity
and Islam — coexist in peace and in mutual respect. Yet the medieval forces of radical Islam, which
the world just saw storming American Embassies
throughout the Middle East, oppose that. They seek
supremacy over all Muslims. They are bent on world
conquest. They want to destroy Israel, Europe, America.
They want to extinguish freedom. They want to end the
modern world.
Militant Islam has many branches, from the rulers
of Iran with their Revolutionary Guards to Al-Qaida
terrorists to the radical cells lurking in every part of the
globe. But despite their differences, they are all rooted
in the same bitter soil of intolerance. That intolerance
is directed first at their fellow Muslims and then at
Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, secular people,
and anyone who does not submit to their unforgiving
creed. They want to drag humankind back to an age of
unquestioning dogma and unrelenting conflict.
I am sure of one thing. Ultimately, they will fail.
Ultimately, light will penetrate the darkness. We
have seen that happen before. Some 500 years ago,
the printing press helped pry a cloistered Europe
out of a dark age. Eventually, ignorance gave way to
enlightenment. So too, a cloistered Middle East will
eventually yield to the irresistible power of freedom
and technology. When that happens, our region will be
guided not by fanaticism and conspiracy but by reason
and curiosity.
I think the relevant question is not whether this
fanaticism will be defeated. It is how many lives will
be lost before it is defeated. We have seen that happen
before too. Some 70 years ago, the world saw another
fanatic ideology bent on world conquest. It went down
in flames, but not before it took millions of people with
it. Those who opposed that fanaticism waited too long
to act. In the end they triumphed, but at a horrific cost.
My friends, we cannot let that happen again. At
stake is not merely the future of my own country. At
stake is the future of the world. Nothing could imperil
our common future more than the arming of Iran with
nuclear weapons. To understand what the world would
be like with a nuclear-armed Iran, just imagine the
world with a nuclear-armed Al-Qaida. It makes little
difference whether these lethal weapons are in the
hands of the world’s most dangerous terrorist regime or
the world’s most dangerous terrorist organization. They
are both fired by the same hatred; they are both driven
by the same lust for violence. Just look at what the Iranian regime has done up
until now, without nuclear weapons. In 2009, they
brutally put down mass protests for democracy in their
own country. Today, their henchmen are participating
in the slaughter of tens of thousands of Syrian
civilians, including thousands of children — directly
participating in those murders. They abetted the killing
of American soldiers in Iraq and continue to do so
in Afghanistan. Before that, Iranian proxies killed
hundreds of American troops in Beirut and in Saudi
Arabia. They have turned Lebanon and Gaza into terror
strongholds, embedding nearly 100,000 missiles and
rockets in civilian areas. Thousands of such rockets and
missiles have already been fired at Israeli communities
by their terrorist proxies.
In the past year, they have spread their international
terror networks to two dozen countries across five
continents, from India and Thailand to Kenya and
Bulgaria. They have even plotted to blow up a restaurant
a few blocks from the White House in order to kill a
diplomat. And of course, Iran’s rulers repeatedly deny
the Holocaust and call for Israel’s destruction almost
on a daily basis, as they did again this week from the
United Nations.
So I ask, given this record of Iranian aggression
without nuclear weapons, just imagine Iranian
aggression with nuclear weapons. Imagine their long-
range missiles tipped with nuclear warheads, their
terror networks armed with atomic bombs. Who here
would feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safe
in Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would
be safe anywhere?
There are those who believe that a nuclear-armed
Iran can be deterred like the Soviet Union. That is a
very dangerous assumption. Militant jihadists behave
very differently from secular Marxists. There were
no Soviet suicide bombers. Yet Iran produces hordes
of them. Deterrence worked with the Soviets, because
every time the Soviets faced a choice between their
ideology and their survival, they chose their survival.
But deterrence may not work with the Iranians once
they get nuclear weapons.
A great scholar of the Middle East, Professor
Bernard Lewis, put it best. He said that for the ayatollahs
of Iran mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent,
it is an inducement. Iran’s apocalyptic leaders believe
that a medieval holy man will reappear in the wake
of a devastating holy war, thereby ensuring that their brand of radical Islam will rule the Earth. That is not
just what they believe; it is what is actually guiding
their policies and their actions. Just listen to Ayatollah
Rafsanjani who said, “the use of even one nuclear bomb
inside Israel will destroy everything, however it would
only harm the Islamic world.” Rafsanjani said: “It is
not irrational to contemplate such an eventuality”. “Not
irrational” is what he said. And that is coming from one
of the so-called moderates of Iran.
Shockingly, some people have begun to peddle the
absurd notion that a nuclear-armed Iran would actually
stabilize the Middle East. That is like saying a nuclear-
armed Al-Qaida would usher in an era of universal
peace.
I have been speaking about the need to prevent Iran
from developing nuclear weapons for over 15 years.
I spoke about it in my first term in office as Prime
Minister, and then I spoke about it when I left office.
I spoke about it when it was fashionable, and I spoke
about it when it was not fashionable.
I speak about it now because the hour is getting
late, very late. I speak about it now because the Iranian
nuclear calendar does not take time out for anyone or
for anything. I speak about it now because when it
comes to the survival of my country, it is not only my
right to speak, it is my duty to speak. And I believe that
it is the duty of every responsible leader who wants to
preserve world peace.
For nearly a decade, the international community
has tried to stop the Iranian nuclear programme with
diplomacy. That has not worked. Iran uses diplomatic
negotiations as a means to buy time to advance its nuclear
programme. For over seven years, the international
community has tried sanctions with Iran. Under the
leadership of President Obama, the international
community has passed some of the strongest sanctions
to date.
I want to thank the Governments represented here
that have joined in that effort. It has had an effect. Oil
exports have been curbed and the Iranian economy
has been hit hard. It has had an effect on the economy,
but we must face the truth. Sanctions have not stopped
Iran’s nuclear programme either.
According to the International Atomic Energy
Agency, during the last year alone, Iran doubled the
number of centrifuges in its underground nuclear
facility in Qom. At this late hour, there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs.
That is by placing a clear red line on Iran’s nuclear
weapons programme.
Red lines do not lead to war. Red lines prevent war.
Look at NATO’s charter. It made clear that an attack on
one member country would be considered an attack on
all. NATO’s red line helped keep the peace in Europe
for nearly half a century. President Kennedy set a red
line during the Cuban missile crisis. That red line
also prevented war and helped preserve the peace for
decades.
In fact, it is the failure to place red lines that has
often invited aggression. If the Western Powers had
drawn clear red lines during the 1930s, I believe they
would have stopped Nazi aggression, and the Second
World War might have been avoided. In 1990, if
Saddam Hussein had been clearly told that his conquest
of Kuwait would cross a red line, the first Gulf War
might have been avoided.
Clear red lines have also worked with Iran. Earlier
this year, Iran threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz.
The United States drew a clear red line and Iran backed
off. Now, red lines could be drawn in different parts of
Iran’s nuclear weapons programme, but to be credible,
a red line must be drawn first and foremost in one vital
part of their programme: on Iran’s efforts to enrich
uranium.
Now let me explain why. Basically, any bomb
consists of explosive material and a mechanism to
ignite it. The simplest example is gunpowder and a
fuse — that is, you light the fuse and you set off the
gunpowder. In the case of Iran’s plans to build a nuclear
weapon, the gunpowder is enriched uranium. The
fuse is a nuclear detonator. For Iran, amassing enough
enriched uranium is far more difficult than producing
the nuclear fuse. For a country like Iran, it takes many
years to enrich uranium for a bomb. That requires
thousands of centrifuges spinning in tandem in very
big industrial plants. Those Iranian plants are visible
and they are still vulnerable.
In contrast, Iran could produce the nuclear
detonator, the fuse, in a lot less time — maybe under a
year, maybe only a few months. The detonator can be
made in a small workshop the size of a classroom. It
may be very difficult to find and target that workshop,
especially in Iran. That is a country that is bigger than
France, Germany, Italy and Britain combined. The
same is true for the small facility in which they could assemble a warhead or a nuclear device that could be
placed in a container ship. Chances are you will not
find that facility either.
So in fact, the only way that you can credibly
prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, is to
prevent Iran from amassing enough enriched uranium
for a bomb. So how much enriched uranium do you
need for a bomb, and how close is Iran to getting it?
Let me show you. I brought a diagram for you. Here
is the diagram. This is a bomb. This is a fuse.
In the case of Iran’s nuclear plans to build a bomb,
this bomb has to be filled with enough enriched
uranium, and Iran has to go through three stages. In
the first stage they have to enrich enough low-enriched
uranium; in the second stage they have to enrich enough
medium-enriched uranium. And in the third, and
final, stage they have to enrich enough high-enriched
uranium for the first bomb.
Where is Iran? Iran has completed the first stage. It
took them many years, but they completed it, and they
are 70 per cent of the way there. Now they are well
into the second stage. By next spring, at most by next
summer, at current enrichment rates, they will have
finished the medium enrichment and moved on to the
final stage. From there, it is only a few months, possibly
a few weeks, before they get enough enriched uranium
for the first bomb.
What I told the Assembly just now is not based
on secret information. It is not based on military
intelligence. It is based on public reports of the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Anybody can
read them. They are online.
So if these are the facts — and they are — where
should a red line be drawn? A red line should be drawn
right here, before Iran completes the second stage of
nuclear enrichment necessary to make a bomb and
before Iran gets to a point where it is a few months away
or a few weeks away from amassing enough enriched
uranium to make a nuclear weapon.
Each day, that point is getting closer. That is why
I speak today with such a sense of urgency, and that is
why everyone should have a sense of urgency.
There are some who claim that even if Iran
completes the enrichment process, even if it crosses
that red line that I just drew, our intelligence agencies
will know when and where Iran will make the fuse, assemble the bomb and prepare the warhead. No one
appreciates our intelligence agencies more than the
Prime Minister of Israel. All these leading intelligence
agencies are superb, including ours. They have foiled
many attacks, they have saved many lives, but they
are not foolproof. For over two years, our intelligence
agencies did not know that Iran was building a huge
nuclear enrichment plant under a mountain. Do we
want to risk the security of the world on the assumption
that we would find a small workshop in a country half
the size of Europe in time?
The relevant question is not when Iran will get
the bomb. The relevant question is at what stage can
we no longer stop Iran from getting the bomb? The
red line must be drawn on Iran’s nuclear enrichment
programme because these enrichment facilities are the
only nuclear installations that we can definitely see and
credibly target.
I believe that faced with a clear red line, Iran will
back down. This will give more time for sanctions and
diplomacy to convince Iran to dismantle its nuclear
weapons programme altogether.
Two days ago, from this podium, President Obama
reiterated that the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran cannot
be contained (see A/67/PV.6). I very much appreciate
the President’s position, as does everyone in my country.
We share the goal of stopping Iran’s nuclear weapons
programme. This goal unites the people of Israel. It
unites Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike.
and it is shared by important leaders throughout the
world. What I have said today will help ensure that this
common goal is achieved. Israel is in discussions with
the United States over this issue, and I am confident
that we can chart a path forward together.
The clash between modernity and medievalism
need not be a clash between progress and tradition. The
traditions of the Jewish people go back thousands of
years. They are the source of our collective values and
the foundations of our national strength. At the same
time, the Jewish people have always looked towards the
future. Throughout history, we have been at the forefront
of efforts to expand liberty, promote equality and
advance human rights. We champion those principles
not in spite of our traditions but because of them. We
heed the words of the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Amos and
Jeremiah to treat all with dignity and compassion, to
pursue justice and cherish life and to pray and strive for
peace. Those are the timeless values of my people, and they are the Jewish people’s greatest gift to humankind.
Let us commit ourselves today to defending those
values so that we can defend our freedoms and protect
our common civilization."
2,2011,"ISR_post_1998","Israel has extended its 
hand in peace from the moment it was established 
63 years ago. On behalf of Israel and the Jewish 
people, I extend that hand again today. I extend it to 
the people of Egypt and Jordan, with renewed 
friendship for neighbours with whom we have made 
peace. I extend it to the people of Turkey, with respect 
and goodwill. I extend it to the people of Libya and 
Tunisia, with admiration for those trying to build a 
democratic future. I extend it to the other peoples of 
North Africa and the Arabian peninsula, with whom we 
want to forge a new beginning. I extend it to the people 
of Syria, Lebanon and Iran, with awe at the courage of 
those fighting brutal repression.  
 Most especially, I extend my hand to the 
Palestinian people, with whom we seek a just and 
lasting peace. 
 In Israel, our hope for peace never wanes. Our 
scientists, doctors and innovators apply their genius to 
improving the world of tomorrow. Our artists and our 
writers enrich the heritage of humanity. Now, I know 
that this is not exactly the image of Israel that is often 
portrayed in this Hall. After all, it was here in 1975 that 
the age-old yearning of my people to restore our 
national life in our ancient biblical homeland was 
branded, shamefully, as racism. It was right here in 
1980 that the historic peace agreement between Israel 
and Egypt was not praised, but denounced. It is here, 
year after year, that Israel is unjustly singled out for 
condemnation. It is singled out for condemnation more 
often than all the nations of the world combined. 
Twenty-one out of 27 relevant General Assembly 
resolutions condemn Israel, the one true democracy in 
the Middle East.  
 This is an unfortunate part of the United Nations 
institution. It is the theatre of the absurd. It not only 
casts Israel as the villain, it often casts real villains in 
leading roles. Al-Qadhafi’s Libya chaired the 
Commission on Human Rights. Saddam’s Iraq headed 
the Conference on Disarmament.  
 One might say that is the past. Well, here is what 
is happening now — right now, today. Hizbullah-
controlled Lebanon now presides over the Security 
Council. This means, in effect, that a terror 
organization presides over the body entrusted with 
guaranteeing the world’s security. One could not make 
this up. Here in the United Nations, automatic 
majorities can decide anything. They can decide that 
the sun rises in the west. They can also decide — they 
have decided — that the Western Wall in Jerusalem, 
Judaism’s holiest place, is occupied Palestinian 
territory. 
 Yet, even here in the General Assembly, the truth 
can sometimes break through. In 1984, when I was 
appointed Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, I 
 
 
37 11-51185 
 
visited the great rabbi of Lubavitch. He said to me — 
and I do not want anyone here to be offended, because 
from personal experience of serving here, I know there 
are many honourable men and women, many capable 
and decent people, serving their nations here — but 
here is what the rebbe said to me. He said, “You will be 
serving in a house of many lies”. And then he said, 
“Remember that, even in the darkest place, the light of 
a single candle can be seen far and wide”. Today I hope 
that the light of truth will shine, if only for a few 
minutes, in a Hall that for too long has been a place of 
darkness for my country.  
 As Israel’s Prime Minister, I did not come here to 
win applause. I came here to speak the truth. The truth 
is that Israel wants peace. The truth is that I want 
peace. The truth is that in the Middle East, at all times 
but especially during these turbulent days, peace must 
be anchored in security. The truth is that we can 
achieve peace not through United Nations resolutions, 
but only through direct negotiations between the 
parties. The truth is that so far the Palestinians have 
refused to negotiate. The truth is that Israel wants 
peace with a Palestinian State, but the Palestinians 
want a State without peace. The truth is that the 
Assembly should not let that happen. 
 When I first came here 27 years ago, the world 
was divided between East and West. Since then, the 
Cold War ended, great civilizations have risen from 
centuries of slumber, hundreds of millions have been 
lifted out of poverty, countless more are poised to 
follow, and the remarkable thing is that, so far, this 
monumental historic shift has largely occurred 
peacefully.  
 Yet a malignancy is now growing between East 
and West that threatens the peace of all. It seeks not to 
liberate, but to enslave; not to build, but to destroy. 
That malignancy is militant Islam. It cloaks itself in the 
mantle of a great faith, yet it murders Jews, Christians 
and Muslims alike with unforgiving impartiality. On 
11 September 2001, it killed thousands of Americans 
and left the twin towers in smouldering ruins. Last 
night, I laid a wreath on the 9/11 memorial. It was 
deeply moving. However, as I was going there, one 
thing echoed in my mind: the outrageous words of the 
President of Iran at this rostrum yesterday. He implied 
that 9/11 was an American conspiracy. Some left this 
Hall; everyone should have. 
 Since 9/11, militant Islamists have slaughtered 
countless other innocents in London and Madrid, in 
Baghdad and Mumbai, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and 
in every part of Israel. I believe that the greatest danger 
facing our world is that this fanaticism will arm itself 
with nuclear weapons, and that is precisely what Iran is 
trying to do. Can we imagine that man who ranted here 
yesterday armed with nuclear weapons? 
 The international community must stop Iran 
before it is too late. If Iran is not stopped, we will all 
face the spectre of nuclear terrorism, and the Arab 
Spring could soon become an Iranian winter. That 
would be a tragedy. Millions of Arabs have taken to the 
streets to replace tyranny with liberty, and no one 
would benefit more than Israel if those committed to 
freedom and peace would prevail. 
 That is my fervent hope, but as the Prime 
Minister of Israel, I cannot risk the future of the Jewish 
State on wishful thinking. Leaders must see reality as it 
is, not as it ought to be. We must do our best to shape 
the future, but we cannot wish away the dangers of the 
present. 
 The world around Israel is definitely becoming 
more dangerous. Militant Islam has already taken over 
Lebanon and Gaza. It is determined to tear apart the 
peace treaties between Israel and Egypt and between 
Israel and Jordan. It has poisoned many Arab minds 
against Jews and Israel, and against America and the 
West. It opposes not the policies of Israel but the 
existence of Israel. 
 Now, some argue that if we want to slow down 
the spread of militant Islam, especially in these 
turbulent times, Israel must hurry to make concessions, 
including territorial compromises. And this theory 
sounds simple. Basically it goes like this: leave the 
territory and peace will be advanced. The moderates 
will be strengthened; the radicals will be kept at bay. 
And do not worry about the pesky details of how Israel 
will actually defend itself; international troops will do 
the job. 
 These people say to me constantly, “Just make a 
sweeping offer, and everything will work out”. There is 
only one problem with that theory. We have tried it and 
it has not worked. In 2000, Israel made a sweeping 
peace offer that met virtually all the Palestinian 
demands. Chairman Arafat rejected it. The Palestinians 
then launched a terror attack that claimed 1,000 Israeli 
lives. 
  
 
11-51185 38 
 
 In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert afterwards made 
an even more sweeping offer. President Abbas did not 
even respond to it. But Israel did more than just make 
sweeping offers. We actually left territory. We 
withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 and from every square 
inch of Gaza in 2005. That did not calm the militant 
Islamic storm that threatens us. It only brought the 
storm closer and made it stronger. Hizbullah and 
Hamas fired thousands of rockets against our cities 
from the very territories we had vacated.  
 When Israel left Lebanon and Gaza, the 
moderates did not defeat the radicals; the moderates 
were devoured by the radicals. And I regret to say that 
international troops, including those of the United 
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the European 
Union Border Assistance Mission in Gaza, did not stop 
the radicals from attacking Israel. 
 We left Gaza hoping for peace. We did not freeze 
the settlements in Gaza; we uprooted them. We did 
exactly what the theory says. We got out, went back to 
the 1967 borders and dismantled the settlements. I do 
not think people remember how far we went to achieve 
this. We uprooted thousands of people from their 
homes. We pulled children out of their schools and 
their kindergartens. We bulldozed synagogues. We 
even moved loved ones from their graves. And then, 
having done all that, we gave the keys of Gaza to 
President Abbas. 
 The theory says that it should have all worked 
out, and that President Abbas and the Palestinian 
Authority could now build a peaceful state in Gaza. We 
all remember that the entire world applauded our 
withdrawal as an act of great statesmanship and a bold 
act of peace. But we did not get peace. We got war. We 
got Iran, which, through its proxy, Hamas, promptly 
kicked out the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian 
Authority collapsed in a day — in one day.  
 President Abbas just said from this rostrum that 
the Palestinians are armed only with their hopes and 
dreams. Yes, they are armed with their hopes, dreams 
and 10,000 missiles and Grad rockets supplied by Iran, 
not to mention the river of lethal weapons now flowing 
into Gaza from the Sinai, from Libya and from 
elsewhere. 
 Thousands of missiles have already rained down 
on our cities. So it might be understand, given all this, 
why Israelis rightly ask, “What is to prevent this from 
happening again in the West Bank?” Most of the major 
cities in the south of our country are within a few 
dozen kilometres from Gaza, but in the centre of the 
country opposite the West Bank, our cities are a few 
hundred metres or at most a few kilometres from the 
edge of the West Bank. 
 So I want to ask: Would anyone here bring danger 
so close to their cities and families? Would they act so 
recklessly with the lives of their citizens? Israel is 
prepared to have a Palestinian State in the West Bank, 
but we are not prepared to have another Gaza there. 
And that is why we need to have real security 
arrangements, which the Palestinians simply refuse to 
negotiate with us. 
 Israelis remember the bitter lessons of Gaza. 
Many of Israel’s critics ignore them. They 
irresponsibly advise Israel to go down this same 
perilous path again. We read what these people say and 
it is as if nothing happened. They just repeat the same 
advice and the same formulas as though none of this 
happened. And these critics continue to press Israel to 
make far-reaching concessions without first assuring 
Israel’s security. They praise those who unwittingly 
feed the insatiable crocodile of militant Islam as bold 
statesmen. They cast as enemies of peace those of us 
who insist that we must first erect a sturdy barrier to 
keep the crocodile out, or at the very least jam an iron 
bar between its gaping jaws. 
 So in the face of the labels and the libels, Israel 
must heed better advice. It is better to receive bad press 
than a good eulogy, and better still would be a fair 
press whose sense of history extends beyond breakfast 
and that recognizes Israel’s legitimate security 
concerns. I believe that in serious peace negotiations, 
these needs and concerns can be properly addressed, 
but they will not be addressed without negotiations.  
 And the needs are many, because Israel is such a 
tiny country. Without Judea and Samaria — the West 
Bank — Israel is all of nine miles wide. I want to put 
that in perspective for all of us in this city. It is about 
two-thirds the length of Manhattan. It is the distance 
between Battery Park and Columbia University. And 
let us not forget that the people who live in Brooklyn 
and New Jersey are considerably nicer than some of 
Israel’s neighbours.  
 So how does one protect such a tiny country, 
surrounded by people sworn to its destruction and 
armed to the teeth by Iran? Obviously, one cannot 
defend it from within that narrow space alone. Israel 
 
 
39 11-51185 
 
needs greater strategic depth, and that is exactly why 
Security Council resolution 242 (1967) did not require 
Israel to leave all of the territories it captured in the 
Six-Day War. It talked about withdrawal from 
territories to secure and defensible boundaries. And to 
defend itself, Israel must therefore maintain a long-
term Israeli military presence in critical strategic areas 
in the West Bank. 
 I explained this to President Abbas. He answered 
that if a Palestinian State was to be a sovereign 
country, it could never accept such arrangements. Why 
not? The United States has had troops in Japan, 
Germany and South Korea for more than a half a 
century. Britain has an air base in Cyprus. France has 
forces in three independent African nations. None of 
those States claim that they are not sovereign countries.  
 There are many other vital security issues that 
also must be addressed. Take the issue of airspace. 
Again, Israel’s small dimensions create huge security 
problems. The United States can be crossed by jet 
airplane in six hours. To fly across Israel, it takes three 
minutes. So is Israel’s tiny airspace to be chopped in 
half and given to a Palestinian State not at peace with 
Israel?  
 Our major international airport is a few 
kilometres from the West Bank. Without peace, will 
our planes become targets for anti-aircraft missiles 
placed in the adjacent Palestinian State? And how will 
we stop the smuggling into the West Bank? It is not 
merely the West Bank; it is the West Bank mountains, 
which dominate the coastal plain below where most of 
Israel’s population sits. How could we prevent the 
smuggling into those mountains of missiles that could 
be fired at our cities?  
 I bring up these problems because they are not 
theoretical problems. They are very real, and for 
Israelis, they are life-and-death matters. All of these 
potential cracks in Israel’s security have to be sealed in 
a peace agreement before a Palestinian State is 
declared, not afterwards, because if it is left until 
afterwards they will not be sealed. And these problems 
will explode in our face and explode the peace.  
 The Palestinians should first make peace with 
Israel and then get their State. But I also want to say 
this. After such a peace agreement is signed, Israel will 
not be the last country to welcome a Palestinian State 
as a new Member of the United Nations. We will be the 
first.  
 There is one more thing. Hamas has been 
violating international law by holding our soldier Gilad 
Shalit captive for five years. They have not allowed 
even one Red Cross visit. He is held in a dungeon, in 
darkness, against all international norms. Gilad Shalit 
is the son of Aviva and Noam Shalit. He is the 
grandson of Zvi Shalit, who escaped the Holocaust by 
coming to the land of Israel as a boy in the 1930s. 
Gilad Shalit is the son of every Israeli family. Every 
nation represented here should demand his immediate 
release. If we want to adopt a resolution about the 
Middle East today, that is the resolution we should 
adopt.  
 Last year in Israel at Bar-Ilan University, and this 
year in the Knesset and the United States Congress, I 
laid out my vision for peace, in which a demilitarized 
Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State. Yes, the 
Jewish State. After all, this is the body that recognized 
the Jewish State 64 years ago. Now, does the Assembly 
not think that it is about time that Palestinians did the 
same?  
 The Jewish State of Israel will always protect the 
rights of all of its minorities, including the more than 
1 million Arab citizens of Israel. I wish I could say the 
same thing about a future Palestinian State, for as 
Palestinian officials made clear the other day — in 
fact, I think they did so right here in New York — the 
Palestinian State would not allow any Jews. They 
would be Jew-free — Judenrein. That is ethnic 
cleansing. There are laws today in Ramallah that make 
the selling of land to Jews punishable by death. That is 
racism. And the Assembly knows which laws this 
evokes.  
 Israel has no intention whatsoever of changing 
the democratic character of our State. We just do not 
want the Palestinians to try to change the Jewish 
character of our State. We want them to give up the 
fantasy of flooding Israel with millions of Palestinians.  
 President Abbas just stood here and said that the 
settlements lie at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflicts. Well, that is odd. Our conflict was raging for 
nearly half a century before there was a single Israeli 
settlement in the West Bank. So, if what President 
Abbas is saying was true, then I guess that the 
settlements he is talking about are Tel Aviv, Haifa, 
Jaffa and Be?er Sheva. Maybe that is what he meant the 
other day when he said that Israel had been occupying 
  
 
11-51185 40 
 
Palestinian land for 63 years. He did not say from 
1967; he said from 1948.  
 I hope that somebody will bother to ask him this 
question, because it illustrates a simple truth. The core 
of the conflict is not the settlements; the settlements 
are a result of the conflict. The settlements are an issue 
that has to be addressed and resolved in the course of 
negotiations. But the core of the conflict has always 
been, and unfortunately remains, the refusal of the 
Palestinians to recognize a Jewish State within any 
border.  
 I think it is time that the Palestinian leadership 
recognize what every serious international leader from 
Lord Balfour and David Lloyd George in 1917, to 
President Truman in 1948, to President Obama just two 
days ago right here, has recognized — that Israel is the 
Jewish State.  
 I would ask President Abbas to stop walking 
around this issue, recognize the Jewish State, and make 
peace with us. In such a genuine peace, Israel is 
prepared to make painful compromises. We believe that 
the Palestinians should be neither the citizens of Israel 
nor its subjects. They should live in a free State of their 
own. But they should be ready, like us, for 
compromise. And we will know that they are ready for 
compromise and peace when they start taking Israel’s 
security requirements seriously and when they stop 
denying our historical connection to our ancient 
homeland. I often hear them accuse Israel of Judaizing 
Jerusalem. That is like accusing America of 
Americanizing Washington, D.C., or the British of 
Anglicizing London. Why are we called Jews? Because 
we come from Judea.  
 In my office in Jerusalem, there is an ancient 
seal. It is a signet ring of a Jewish official from the 
time of the Bible. The seal was found right next to the 
Western Wall and it dates back 2,700 years to the time 
of King Hezekiah. Now, the name of a Jewish official 
is inscribed on the ring in Hebrew. His name was 
Netanyahu. That is my last name. My first name, 
Benjamin, can be traced back a 1,000 years to 
Benjamin — Binyamin — the son of Jacob, who was 
also known as Israel. Jacob and his 12 sons roamed 
these same hills of Judea and Samaria 4,000 years ago, 
and there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the 
land ever since.  
 Those Jews who were exiled from our land — 
Jews in Spain, on the eve of their expulsion; Jews in 
Ukraine, fleeing the pogroms; Jews fighting in the 
Warsaw Ghetto, as the Nazis were circling around it — 
never stopped dreaming of coming back. They never 
stopped praying, they never stopped yearning. They 
whispered: “Next year in Jerusalem. Next year in the 
promised land”.  
 As the Prime Minister of Israel, I speak for a 
hundred generations of Jews who were dispersed 
throughout the lands and suffered every evil under the 
sun, but who never gave up hope of restoring their 
national life in the one and only Jewish State.  
 I continue to hope that President Abbas will be 
my partner in peace. I have worked hard to advance 
that peace. The day I came into office, I called for 
direct negotiations without preconditions. President 
Abbas did not respond. I outlined a vision of peace of 
two States for two peoples. He still did not respond. I 
removed hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints to 
ease freedom of movement in the Palestinian areas. 
This facilitated fantastic growth in the Palestinian 
economy. But again, there was no response. I took the 
unprecedented step of freezing new building in the 
settlements for 10 months. No Prime Minister had done 
that before, ever. Once again, I hear applause, but there 
was no response. No response.  
 In the past few weeks, American officials have 
put forward ideas to restart peace talks. There were 
things in those ideas about borders that I did not like. 
There were things there about the Jewish State that I 
am sure the Palestinians did not like. But despite all of 
my reservations, I was willing to move forward on 
those American ideas. Why does President Abbas not 
join me? We have to stop negotiating about the 
negotiations. Let us just get on with it. Let us negotiate 
peace.  
 I spent years defending Israel on the battlefield. I 
spent decades defending Israel in the court of public 
opinion. President Abbas has dedicated his life to 
advancing the Palestinian cause. Must this conflict 
continue for generations, or will we enable our children 
and our grandchildren to speak in the years ahead of 
how we found a way to end it? That is what we should 
aim for, and that is what I believe we can achieve.  
 In two and a half years, President Abbas and I 
have met in Jerusalem only once, even though my door 
has always been open to him. If he wishes, I will come 
to Ramallah. Actually, I have a better suggestion. We 
have both just flown thousands of miles to New York. 
 
 
41 11-51185 
 
Now we are in the same city; we are in the same 
building. So let us meet here today, at the United 
Nations. Who is there to stop us? What is there to stop 
us? If we genuinely want peace, what is there to stop 
us from meeting today and beginning peace 
negotiations? 
 I suggest that we talk openly and honestly. Let us 
listen to one another. Let us, as we say in the Middle 
East, talk dugri. That means “straightforward”. I will 
tell him my needs and concerns; he will tell me his. 
And with God’s help, we will find the common ground 
of peace.  
 There is an old Arab saying that one cannot 
applaud with one hand. Well, the same is true of peace. 
I cannot make peace alone. I cannot make peace 
without an interlocutor. President Abbas, I extend my 
hand — the hand of Israel — in peace. I hope that he 
will grasp that hand. We are both the sons of Abraham. 
My people call him Avraham; his people call him 
Ibrahim. We share the same patriarch. We dwell in the 
same land. Our destinies are intertwined. Let us realize 
the vision of Isaiah: “The people who walk in darkness 
will see a great light”. (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 9:2). Let 
that light be the light of peace."
2,2009,"ISR_post_1998","Nearly 62 years ago, the 
United Nations recognized the right of the Jews, an 
ancient people 3,500 years old, to a State of their own 
in their ancestral homeland. I stand here today as the 
Prime Minister of Israel, the Jewish State, and I speak 
to the Assembly on behalf of my country and my 
people. 
 The United Nations was founded after the 
carnage of the Second World War and the horrors of 
the Holocaust. It was charged with preventing the 
reoccurrence of such horrendous events. Nothing has 
undermined that mission, nothing has impeded it more, 
than the systematic assault on the truth. Yesterday, the 
President of Iran stood at this very rostrum spewing his 
latest anti-Semitic rants. Just a few days earlier, he 
again claimed that the Holocaust was a lie. 
 Last month, I went to a villa in a suburb of Berlin 
called Wannsee. There, on 20 January 1942, after a 
hearty meal, senior Nazi officials met and decided to 
exterminate my people. They left detailed minutes of 
that meeting that have been preserved for posterity by 
successive German Governments. I have here a copy of 
the minutes of the meeting of senior Nazi officials 
instructing the Nazi Government exactly how to carry 
out the extermination of the Jewish people. Is that 
protocol a lie? Are the German Government and all 
German Governments lying? 
 The day before I was in Wannsee, in Berlin I was 
given the original construction plans for the 
Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. I now hold in 
my hand the Auschwitz-Birkenau plans. They contain 
the signature of Heinrich Himmler, Hitler’s deputy, 
himself. Are those plans for the Auschwitz-Birkenau 
concentration camp, where 1 million Jews were 
murdered, a lie too? In June, President Obama visited 
another concentration camp, one of many — the 
 
 
09-52320 36 
 
Buchenwald concentration camp. Did President Obama 
pay tribute to a lie? 
 And what of the Auschwitz survivors, whose 
arms still bear the tattooed numbers branded on them 
by the Nazis? Are those tattoos a lie, too? One third of 
all Jews perished in the great conflagration of the 
Holocaust. Nearly every Jewish family, including my 
own, was affected. My wife’s grandparents, her 
father’s two sisters and three brothers, and all the 
aunts, uncles and cousins were murdered by the Nazis. 
Is that a lie?   
 Yesterday, the man who calls the Holocaust a lie 
spoke from this rostrum. I commend those who refused 
to come and those who left in protest. They stood up 
for moral clarity and brought honour to their countries. 
But to those who gave that denier of the Holocaust a 
hearing, I say on behalf of my people, the Jewish 
people, and of decent people everywhere: Have they no 
shame? Have they no decency? A mere six decades 
after the Holocaust, they give legitimacy to a man who 
denies the murder of 6 million Jews, while promising 
to wipe out the State of Israel, the State of the Jews. 
 That is a disgrace. It is a mockery of the Charter 
of the United Nations. Perhaps some representatives 
think that that man and his odious regime threaten only 
the Jews. If they believe that, they are wrong — dead 
wrong. History has shown us time and again that what 
starts with attacks on the Jews eventually ends up 
engulfing many, many others.  
 For this Iranian regime is fuelled by an extreme 
fundamentalism that burst onto the world scene three 
decades ago after lying dormant for centuries. In the 
past 30 years, that fanaticism has swept across the 
globe with a murderous violence that knows no bounds 
and with a cold-blooded impartiality in the choice of 
its victims. It has callously slaughtered Muslims, 
Christians, Jews, Hindus and many others. The 
adherents of that unforgiving creed, although it is 
comprised of different offshoots, seek to return 
humanity to medieval times. Wherever they can, they 
impose a backward, regimented society where women, 
minorities, gays or anyone else deemed not to be a true 
believer is brutally subjugated.  
 The struggle against that fanaticism does not pit 
faith against faith, or civilization against civilization. It 
pits civilization against barbarism, the twenty-first 
century against the ninth, and those who sanctify life 
against those who glorify death. The primitivism of the 
ninth century ought to be no match for the progress of 
the twenty-first. The allure of freedom, the power of 
technology and the reach of communications should 
surely win the day. Ultimately, the past cannot triumph 
over the future, and our future offers all nations 
magnificent bounties of hope because the pace of 
progress is growing, and growing exponentially.  
 It took us centuries to get from the printing press 
to the telephone, decades to get from the telephone to 
the personal computer, and only a few years to get 
from the personal computer to the Internet. What 
seemed impossible a few years ago is already outdated, 
and we can scarcely fathom the changes that are yet to 
come. We will crack the genetic code. We will cure the 
incurable. We will lengthen our lives. We will find a 
cheap alternative to fossil fuel, and we will clean up 
the planet.    
 I am proud that my country, Israel, is at the 
forefront of many of those advances in science and 
technology, medicine and biology, agriculture and 
water, and energy and the environment. Those 
innovations in my country and in many others offer 
humanity a sunlit future of unimagined promise. 
 However, if the most primitive fanaticism can 
acquire the most deadly weapons, the march of history 
could be reversed for a time and, like the belated 
victory over the Nazis, the forces of progress and 
freedom prevail only after a horrific toll of blood and 
fortune has been exacted from mankind. That is why 
the greatest threat facing the world today is the 
marriage between religious fundamentalism and the 
weapons of mass destruction.  
 The most urgent challenge facing this body today 
is to prevent the tyrants of Tehran from acquiring 
nuclear weapons. Are the Members of the United 
Nations up to that challenge? Will the international 
community confront a despotism that terrorizes its own 
people as they bravely stand up for freedom? Will it 
take action against the dictators who stole an election 
in broad daylight and then gunned down Iranian 
protesters, who died on the sidewalks and in the streets 
choking in their own blood? Will the international 
community thwart the world’s most pernicious sponsor 
and practitioner of terrorism? Above all, will the 
international community stop the terrorist regime of 
Iran from developing atomic weapons and thereby 
endangering the peace of the entire world? 
 
 
37 09-52320 
 
 The people of Iran are courageously standing up 
to this regime. People of goodwill around the world 
stand with them, as do the thousands who have been 
protesting outside this Hall throughout the week. Will 
the United Nations stand with them? 
 The jury is still out on the United Nations. Recent 
signs are not encouraging. Rather than condemning the 
terrorists and their Iranian patrons, some here in the 
United Nations have condemned their victims. This is 
exactly what a recent United Nations report on Gaza 
did, falsely equating the terrorists with those they 
targeted. 
 For eight long years, Hamas fired rockets from 
Gaza on nearby Israeli cities and citizens — thousands 
of missiles and mortars hailing down from the sky on 
schools, homes, shopping centres and bus stops. Year 
after year, as these missiles were deliberately fired on 
our civilians, not one single United Nations resolution 
was passed condemning those criminal attacks. We 
heard nothing — absolutely nothing — from the 
Human Rights Council of the United Nations, a 
misnamed institution if ever there was one. 
 In 2005, hoping to advance peace, Israel 
unilaterally withdrew from every inch of Gaza. It was 
very painful. We dismantled 21 settlements, really 
bedroom communities and farms. We uprooted over 
8,000 Israelis; we just yanked them out of their homes. 
We did this because many in Israel believed that it 
would win peace. Well, we did not get peace. Instead 
we got an Iranian-backed terror base 50 miles from 
Tel Aviv. But life in the Israeli towns and cities 
immediately adjacent to Gaza became nothing less than 
a nightmare. The Hamas rocket attacks not only 
continued after we left, they actually increased 
dramatically. They increased tenfold. And again, the 
United Nations was silent — absolutely silent. 
 Well, after eight years of this unremitting assault, 
Israel was finally forced to respond. But how should 
we have responded? There is only one example in 
history of thousands of rockets being fired on a 
country’s civilian population. This happened when the 
Nazis rocketed British cities during the Second World 
War. During that war, the Allies levelled German cities, 
causing hundreds of thousands of casualties. I am not 
passing judgement; I am stating a fact, a fact that is the 
product of the decisions of great and honourable 
men — the leaders of Britain and the United States — 
fighting an evil force in the Second World War. 
 It is also a fact that Israel chose to respond 
differently. Faced with an enemy committing a double 
war crime — firing on civilians while hiding behind 
civilians — Israel sought to conduct surgical strikes 
against the rocket-launchers themselves. That was no 
easy task because the terrorists were firing their 
missiles from homes and schools, using mosques as 
weapons depots and missile caches, and ferreting 
explosives in ambulances. 
 Israel, by contrast, tried to minimize casualties by 
urging Palestinian civilians to vacate the targeted 
areas. We dropped countless flyers over their homes. 
We sent thousands and thousands of text messages to 
the Palestinian residents. We made thousands and 
thousands of cellular phone calls urging them to 
vacate, to leave. Never has a country gone to such 
extraordinary lengths to remove the enemy’s civilian 
population from harm’s way.  
 Yet faced with an absolutely clear-cut case of 
aggressor and victim, who do you think the United 
Nations Human Rights Council decided to condemn? 
Israel. A democracy legitimately defending itself 
against terror is morally hanged, drawn and quartered, 
and given an unfair trial to boot. By these twisted 
standards, the Human Rights Council would have 
dragged Roosevelt and Churchill to the dock as war 
criminals. What a perversion of truth! What a 
perversion of justice! 
 The delegates to the United Nations and the 
Governments that they represent have a decision to 
make. Will they accept this farce? Because if they do, 
the United Nations would revert to its darkest days, 
when the worst violators of human rights sat in 
judgement against the law-abiding democracies, when 
Zionism was equated with racism and when an 
automatic majority could be mustered to declare that 
the Earth is flat. If you had to choose a date when the 
United Nations began its descent, almost a freefall, and 
lost the respect of many thoughtful people in the 
international community, it was the day in 1975 it 
decided to equate Zionism with racism. 
 Now this body has a choice to make. If it does 
not reject this biased report, it would vitiate itself, it 
would recommence the process of vitiating its own 
relevance and importance. But it would also do 
something else. It would send the message to terrorists 
everywhere that terrorism pays: all you have to do is 
 
 
09-52320 38 
 
launch your attacks from densely populated areas, and 
you will win immunity. 
 A third point: in condemning Israel, this body 
would also deal a mortal blow to peace. Let me explain 
why. When Israel left Gaza, many hoped that the 
missile attacks would stop. Others believed that, even 
if they did not stop, at the very least Israel, in having 
made this extraordinary gesture for peace, would have 
international legitimacy to exercise its right of self-
defence if peace failed. What legitimacy? What self-
defence? 
 The same United Nations that cheered Israel as it 
left Gaza and promised to back our right of self-
defence now accuses us — my people, my country — 
of being war criminals? And for what? For acting 
responsibly in self-defence? For acting in a way that 
any country would act, with a restraint unmatched by 
many? What a travesty! 
 Israel justly defended itself against terror. This 
biased and unjust report provides a clear-cut test for all 
Governments. Will the Assembly stand with Israel or 
will it stand with the terrorists? We must know the 
answer to that question now. Now, not later. Because if 
Israel is again asked to take more risks for peace, we 
must know today that the Assembly will stand with us 
tomorrow. Only if we have the confidence that we can 
defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace. 
 Make no mistake: all of Israel wants peace. Any 
time an Arab leader genuinely wanted peace with us, 
we made peace. We made peace with Egypt led by 
Anwar Sadat. We made peace with Jordan led by King 
Hussein. And if the Palestinians truly want peace, my 
Government and I, and my people, will make peace. 
But we want a genuine peace, a defensible peace, a 
permanent peace.  
 In 1947, this body voted to establish two States 
for two peoples — a Jewish State and an Arab State. 
The Jews accepted that resolution. The Arabs rejected 
it and invaded the embryonic Jewish State with the 
hopes of annihilating it. 
 We ask the Palestinians to finally do what they 
have refused to do for 62 years: say yes to a Jewish 
State. It is as simple, as clear and as elementary as that. 
Just as we are asked to recognize a nation-State of the 
Palestinian people, the Palestinians must be asked to 
recognize the nation-State of the Jewish people. The 
Jewish people are not foreign conquerors in the Land 
of Israel. It is the land of our forefathers. 
 Inscribed on the walls outside this building is the 
great Biblical vision of peace: “Nation shall not lift up 
sword against nation. They shall learn war no more.” 
These words were spoken by the great Jewish prophet 
Isaiah 2,800 years ago as he walked in my country, in 
my city, in the hills of Judea and in the streets of 
Jerusalem.  
 We are not strangers to this land. This is our 
homeland. But as deeply connected as we are to our 
homeland, we also recognize that the Palestinians also 
live there and they want a home of their own. We want 
to live side by side with them — two free peoples 
living in peace, living in prosperity, living in dignity.  
 Peace, prosperity and dignity require one other 
element: we must have security. The Palestinians 
should have all the powers to govern themselves except 
a handful of powers that could endanger Israel. That is 
why the Palestinian State must be effectively 
demilitarized. I say “effectively” because we do not 
want another Gaza, another south Lebanon, another 
Iranian-backed terror base abutting Jerusalem and 
perched on the hills a few kilometres from Tel Aviv. 
 We want peace. I believe that with goodwill and 
with hard work such a peace can be achieved. But it 
requires that all of us roll back the forces of terror led 
by Iran that seek to destroy peace, that seek to 
eliminate Israel and to overthrow the world order.  The 
question facing the international community is whether 
it is prepared to confront those forces, or will it 
accommodate them. 
 Over 70 years ago, Winston Churchill lamented 
what he called the “confirmed unteachability of 
mankind”. By that he meant the unfortunate habit of 
civilized societies to sleep and to slumber until danger 
nearly overtakes them. Churchill bemoaned what he 
called the  
 “want of foresight, unwillingness to act when 
action would be simple and effective, lack of 
clear thinking, confusion of counsel until the 
emergency comes, until self-preservation strikes 
its jarring gong …”. 
 I speak here today in the hope that Churchill’s 
assessment of the “unteachability of mankind” is for 
once proven wrong. I speak here today in the hope that 
 
 
39 09-52320 
 
we can learn from history, that we can prevent danger 
in time. 
 In the spirit of the timeless words spoken to 
Joshua over 3,000 years ago, let us be strong and of 
good courage.  Let us confront this peril, secure our 
future and, God willing, forge an enduring peace for 
generations to come. 
(spoke in Hebrew) 
 May God bless his people with peace; may God  
give strength to his people; may God bless his people 
with peace."
2,2010,"ISR_post_1998","When I arrived yesterday 
in New York, I received a phone call from the chairman 
of one of the Jewish organizations, who asked me how 
I was coping with all the pressure that is being placed 
on Israel. “Surely”, he said, “it must be very difficult”. 
I recalled an old joke, which tells of five Jews who 
changed the way we see the world: Moses, law is 
everything; Jesus, love is everything; Marx, money is 
everything; Freud, sex is everything; and Einstein, 
everything is relative. So, I told him that everything is 
relative. On one hand, it is very difficult. On the other 
hand, it is easier than before, because now we have a 
stable coalition and a stable Government and we have 
the support of a majority of Israel’s citizens. We are 
ready for a fair solution and we are ready to cooperate 
with the international community. However, we are not 
ready to compromise our national security or the vital 
interests of the State of Israel. 
 At the outset, I want to emphasize that, contrary 
to what is often presented in the international media, 
the political arena in Israel is not divided between 
those who seek peace and those who seek war. 
Everyone wants peace, and the controversy in Israel 
centres on the specific question of how to achieve this 
peace, how to reach security and stability in the region. 
And the question is: why, in the 17 years since we 
signed the Oslo Accords, have we not arrived at a 
comprehensive agreement signifying the end of the 
conflict and the removal of future mutual claims? 
 Despite all of the efforts of all the good people 
with the best of intentions, including Yitzhak Rabin, 
Shimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barak, Ariel 
Sharon and Ehud Olmert; despite the summit meetings 
at Camp David between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat 
with the presence of former President Bill Clinton; and 
despite the Annapolis Summit between Ehud Olmert 
and Mahmoud Abbas, we are today still in deadlock. 
 In fact, contrary to the prevalent view that the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the heart of the instability 
in the Middle East or is the main reason for the 
region’s numerous conflicts, the reality is entirely 
different. More than 90 per cent of the wars and war 
victims of the Middle East since the Second World War 
did not result from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and 
are in no way connected to Israel. Rather, they stem 
from conflicts involving Muslims or conflicts between 
Arab States. The Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf war, the wars 
between North and South Yemen, the Hama atrocities 
in Syria, and the wars in Algeria and Lebanon — these 
are just a few examples from a list that goes on and on. 
 The second flawed explanation for the 
long-standing conflict between Israel and the 
Palestinians that has gained popularity is that the root 
of the problem is the so-called occupation, the 
settlements in Judea and Samaria and the settlers 
themselves. Only the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian State in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, so the 
argument goes, will ensure peace in the region. 
 It is sufficient to state a number of well-known 
facts in order to refute that claim. First, all of Judea, 
Samaria and Gaza were under Arab control for 
19 years, between 1948 and 1967. During those 
19 years, no one tried to create a Palestinian State. 
Peace agreements were achieved with Egypt and 
Jordan, despite the presence of settlements. And the 
opposite is also true: we evacuated 21 flourishing 
settlements in Gush Katif and transferred more than 
10,000 Jews. And, in return, we have Hamas in power 
and thousands of missiles landing on Sderot and 
southern Israel. 
 Another misguided argument is the claim that the 
Palestinian issue prevents a determined international 
front against Iran. This argument is not only flawed, it 
is completely irresponsible. The same argument could 
be made that the Palestinian issue prevents action on 
North Korea, piracy in Somalia, the humanitarian crisis 
in Sudan or the challenge of Afghanistan. 
 Just as the Khomeini Revolution had nothing to 
do with the Palestinian issue, neither is the Iranian 
decision to develop nuclear weapons related. In truth, 
the connection between Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict is precisely the contrary. Iran can exist without 
Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hizbullah, but the terrorist 
organizations cannot exist without Iran. Relying on 
those proxies, Iran can, at any given time, foil any 
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians or with 
Lebanon. 
 Thus, in searching for a durable agreement with 
the Palestinians, one that will deal with the true roots 
of the conflict and will endure for many years, one 
must understand that, first, the Iranian issue must be 
resolved. One must deal first with the root cause of the 
problem, and not its symptoms. There are, of course, 
yet other problems that must be solved; solving that 
one would not be sufficient, but it is nevertheless a 
necessary condition. 
 
 
9 10-55264 
 
 In trying to resolve the conflict between Israel 
and the Palestinians, we are dealing with two types of 
problems: emotional problems and practical problems. 
That is why the solution must also be a two-stage one. 
 The emotional problems are, first and foremost, 
the utter lack of confidence between the sides and 
issues such as Jerusalem, recognition of Israel as the 
nation-State of the Jewish people, and refugees. Under 
those conditions, we should focus on coming up with a 
long-term intermediate agreement, something that 
could take a few decades. We need to raise an entire 
new generation that will have mutual trust and will not 
be influenced by incitement and extremist messages. 
To achieve a final status agreement, we must 
understand that the primary practical obstacle is the 
friction between the two nations. 
 As is true everywhere, where there are two 
nations, two religions or two languages with competing 
claims to the same land, there is friction and conflict. 
Countless examples of ethnic conflict around the world 
confirm this, whether in the Balkans, the Caucasus, 
Africa, the Far East or the Middle East. Where 
effective separation has been achieved, conflict has 
either been avoided or has been dramatically reduced 
or resolved. Consider the cases of the former Yugoslav 
republics, the split-up of Czechoslovakia and the 
independence of East Timor as cases in point. Thus, the 
guiding principle for a final status agreement must not 
be land-for-peace but rather, exchange of populated 
territory. Let me be very clear: I am not speaking about 
moving populations, but rather about moving borders 
to better reflect demographic realities. 
 This is not an extraordinary insight and is far less 
controversial than some may seek to claim. In fact, 
precisely this notion — that a mismatch between 
borders and nationalities is a recipe for conflict — has 
long been accepted as a virtual truism in the academic 
community. Leading scholars and highly respected 
research institutions have even coined the term “right-
sizing the State” to capture the idea that States and 
nations must be in balance in order to ensure peace. 
This is not a controversial political policy. It is an 
empirical truth. 
 But beyond empirical truth there is historical 
truth, namely, the almost 4,000 years during which the 
Jewish people were born in the land of Israel and 
developed the corpus of ethical and intellectual 
treasures that have been instrumental in the rise of 
Western civilization. The 2,000 years of forced exile 
and interim conquest by Byzantines, Arabs, 
Mamelukes, Ottomans and others cannot and never will 
impair the unbreakable bonds of the Jewish people to 
its homeland. Israel is not only where we are, it is who 
we are. 
 In closing, let me remind everyone in this Hall of 
the quote on the plaza across from the United Nations, 
words spoken in Jerusalem almost 3,000 years ago by 
the Jewish prophet Isaiah: 
 “They shall beat their swords into plowshares and 
their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not 
lift up sword against nation, neither shall they 
learn war any more.” (Isaiah 2:4) 
 Inspired by the deep wisdom embodied in these 
words, let us hope that the path to true peace 
prophesied by Isaiah will guide our two peoples, in two 
nation-States, living in peace and security."
3,2001,"ISR_post_1998","First of all, I would really like
to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President
of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I
know that you bring with you a wealth of experience, a
breadth of understanding and hope for many people. I
would also like to express my highest regard for
9

Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his well-deserved
recognition as Nobel Prize Laureate for his fresh ideas
and great vision on how to meet a new world with an
open mind, a sense of unity and hope.
There is hidden light and needed hope in this
gathering to overturn the darkness that has descended
upon us. There is enough strength and resolve in the
midst of civilized nations to deflect evil.
Humanity woke up happy to welcome the twenty-
first century. We turned around and looked, and there
was brightness and freshness in the air. We had
departed from a traditional history that was written
with red ink — wars, skirmishes, conflicts and
murders — many of which arose because human
existence was dependent upon land and natural
resources. We have had to protect our own lands.
Modern science emerged to supersede land,
opening new horizons of limitless opportunities.
Science rendered borders marginal, and old prejudices
and distances began to dissipate from our minds.
Technology created a new interdependence. No longer
were our connections dependent upon land or sea —
upon distance. Air became the new means of
communication for nations, peoples, businesses and
development. High technology introduced new
promises and recalled the importance of old values.
The perception was that every person,
irrespective of location, race, religion or sex, could
reach new heights. And then we learned that high
technology is not just a technical matter. We cannot
separate technology from values; it is impossible.
For example, you cannot combine lies and
science. You cannot lie scientifically. To have a
science-based economy, you have to pursue peace
uncompromisingly and openness uninterruptedly.
Science requires an open society; it demands constant
dialogue. You cannot have new innovations without
unrestricted research. You cannot have unrestricted
research without being a free society. You cannot
develop a scientific economy without making
education a top priority, available and accessible to all
people. You cannot attract investment unless you have
transparency.
In a competitive world, to keep young scientists
your land and water should be free from pollution, your
financial system free from corruption, your government
without arbitrariness. Truth, freedom and openness
became conditions for science and high technology
and, consequently, for the advancement of any society.
It is true that the world is still divided between
the haves and the have nots. But for the have nots, a
new option is that of becoming connected to the new
age and the more developed aspects of our times.
There had been a new beginning, but like many
beginnings, one mixed with shadows and revolt. The
shadows were not yet heavy; at the beginning they
looked pale and distant. So we felt like one promised
world, like one assembly. The economy was no longer
national; it became global — open to every nation. And
since we could not form a global government, the
national Governments agreed that the global economy
would be managed by private enterprises — hence,
privatization. Globalization decreased the importance
of traditional States and increased the importance of
non-governmental organizations and worldwide
connections. It looked as if borderless progress was
evolving. And then ambushing clouds, global in nature,
moved in as a new horror.
The horrific events of 11 September — the
savage attack on innocent American people —
signalled a new warning to world history. On 11
September, we learned that the very same technology I
mentioned earlier — openness and a frontier-less,
connected world — could also spread viciousness. This
attack was brutal, because it was directed at everything
we stand for, against everything for which nations, and
the United Nations, have toiled.
The emerging terror, like the emerging economy,
is no longer national or delineated by boundaries.
Rather, it is borderless, and it contains unlimited,
awesome potential. It can begin with knives, and it may
wind up with germs. Terror does not have a visible
address, a merciful lord in heaven, a court or an elected
government. Nor does it need the approval of the many.
It is built on the fanaticism of a small group of
murderers, lacking the checks and balances of an
accountable society. It may arrive unexpectedly,
uninvited, spreading fear in every corner of the globe,
paralysing us at work and home, grounding flights,
impeding movement, disrupting commerce and
production. Eventually, it can endanger the freshness of
air, the purity of water.
Global economy arrived as an historic surprise;
global terrorism also arrived without prior warning.
But, whereas a solution was found to regulate the
10

global economy, through privatization, there is no
private answer to meet global terrorism. Many nations
have armies, without necessarily having enemies. Yet,
for the time being, global dangers remain without
global answers or global armies.
The United States played the pivotal role in
introducing the new economy. Now again, it falls upon
the United States, as the first target of global terrorism,
to offer a strategy, to take the lead and to bring back
the promise of freedom and security to many of us.
We pay tribute to the United States, a nation that
had the capacity to welcome new modes of creativity,
planning, production and innovation at home and
abroad. And while becoming mighty, it did not stop
caring for the rest of the world. The United States has
helped nations in Europe and Asia and elsewhere
regain freedom and security in times of danger.
American boys fought, and many of them lost
their lives, in European and Asian wars. They won
wars and gained land, but they did not keep those
assets for themselves. They returned to Japan an
improved Japan. They returned to Germany an
improved Germany. The Marshall Plan helped to
rebuild Europe. Needy countries were offered food and
assistance, industries were restored, economies were
rehabilitated. There was generosity in their victory.
Indeed, America has emerged as the “indispensable
nation”.
Now America has become a target for reasons
which are not necessarily its own. Terrorism was
directed at America to frustrate its democracy, weaken
its respect for human rights, reduce its enterprise and
threaten its individualism so that it would not be able
to help others. This was an assault on the very
existence of humanity.
The bin Laden group are afraid of progress. They
are proponents of backwardness. They want us to
return to living in caves. They represent the darkest
ages in the annals of human history. They are self-
appointed killers of any persons who think differently
from them. They are not just evil — they are an agency
of death.
America is not just a new world or continent — it
is a great constitution, a shining city on the hill of
freedom. It is not just a concrete structure — it is a
solid idea. You can attack America, hurt it, but
America cannot be destroyed.
America’s war on terrorism is the war of all of us.
By “us”, I mean every country in this Assembly and
every human being on this planet. Bin Laden claims
that he fights crusaders, who no longer exist. Bin
Laden claims that he wants to help the Palestinians, but
in the eyes of the Palestinians, he is an obstacle, not an
aid.
Israel made peace with Egypt and returned all the
land and water without bin Ladens, without terror. We
did likewise with the Jordanians — not because of
terror, but because terror came to an end. At Camp
David in July 2000, we offered the Palestinians
practically all the land without bin Ladens, without
terror. And if there remained a difference of 1 or 2 per
cent, that does not justify the killing of thousands of
men and women in America. Political differences do
not justify murdering even a single child, no matter of
which nation.
Bin Laden and his abhorrent ideas can never
contribute to peace. They offer no solution and no hope
to any nation, religion or person. They spread hatred,
disseminate fear and plant mines. They are a
catastrophe at large.
The new world economy enabled two of the most
populous countries — China and India — to move
forward and offer new life and opportunity to hundreds
of millions of people. It has changed the face of
Europe. It has reversed the fortunes of Latin America.
It has extended an open invitation to every country to
acquire computers, widen education, open its gates and
join a new age without giving up its old values and
traditions. The new world economy called for an
assembly of responsible nations to build a dam against
terror, knowing perfectly well that the fight against
terror cannot be postponed, cannot be forgiven, cannot
be compromised. It is a matter of life and death for
humanity in the new chapter of our existence.
All of us, nations and individuals, will either
contribute to safety and freedom or become targets of
death and backwardness. Every country must choose its
place in the new world, either in the realm of science
and technology or in the wastebasket of the old land
economy, dependent on the whims of nature,
condemned to the poverty of hopelessness. It is the
responsibility of affluent nations to share the wealth of
knowledge so that others can join them. Rich countries
should become a locomotive for the deprived, not a
luxury liner for the privileged.
11

We pray wholeheartedly from the great and united
city of Jerusalem, as we did in the early days of our
existence, that we shall know again how to distinguish
between good and evil, between tohu va’vo-hu —
chaos — and a new tomorrow. Our region gave birth to
the greatest prophets, their moral dictums setting the
moral fabric of our society. They have guided us to
trust and follow reason and realism. But we were
forced to follow funerals more than reason. This has
exacted a heavy price from Jews, Muslims, Christians,
Druze. It is time that we rediscovered the Ten
Commandments, holy to all of us.
Right now it looks as if we are again sinking into
the past. The emotional conflict is greater than the
territorial gap. It is more difficult to muster the strength
and summon the spirit than to divide the land. In spite
of these difficulties, I daresay there is a hidden
opportunity in the vast divide. I feel strongly that while
we cannot recover lost time, we can introduce a new
vista in the Middle East.
Until now, the world related to the Middle East.
Now the Middle East has to relate to the new world.
Our neighbours — Palestinians and Arabs — know that
Israel is committed to contribute whatever it can to
renew a real peace process — not by force, not by
imposition, not by unilateral action, but through a
negotiated agreement, an agreed peace. There is no
peace but an agreed peace. Just as one cannot applaud
with one hand, there cannot be a one-handed peace.
Problems, naturally, have a date of birth.
Solutions must reach their maturity. It may not happen
at once, but it will happen. Yesterday, you would
hardly find, for example, support for a Palestinian State
and, although this is not yet a formal policy of the
Government of Israel, there is now support for
Palestinian independence and for a Palestinian State.
We do not want to dominate the Palestinians; we want
them to breathe freedom, to create a new economy, to
maintain their traditions, to enjoy the highest level of
education and to provide real security to all parties.
As far as Israel is concerned, we are convinced
that good neighbours are better than good guns. In
modern times, you cannot have real security dependent
only on fences, walls, fortifications or trenches; not
even on tanks and guns and missiles. All these
measures have already become anti-measures, making
them incomplete and temporary. The only strategy that
cannot be ignored is neighbourly relations, such as the
common market in Europe, the Rio Group in Latin
America, the North American Free Trade Agreement in
North America, the Association of South-East Asian
Nations in Asia and the New Partnership for African
Development in Africa. All these frameworks have
shown that answers to old historical, military and
political conflicts may reside in the economic domain.
What endangers the new solution is terror. Terror
is again endangering the world. The division is no
longer between East and West, North and South, but
between the union to stop terror and those who refuse
to recognize its menace. The assembly against terror
comprises most of humanity: the United States,
Europe, China, Russia, India, South America, many
countries in Africa and many countries in the Muslim
world.
Democracies must have a non-democratic
institution to defend themselves. Armies are non-
democratic, but without them democracy would not
prevail. You may have many views in a democratic
society, but only one authority that controls the military
and its arms. Armies must be subordinate to the elected
political body, but if you have one political authority
and several armed groups, you can have neither
democracy nor security.
The Palestinian Authority, which is a State in
being, must establish one authority over all arms, all
armies and all use of arms, not for the sake of Israel,
but for the sake of peace and for the sake of its own
destiny, so that bullets will not negate ballots.
As long as terror persists, Israel has no choice but
to defend its people. The word “terror” does not
describe an abstract dilemma for us. It refers to a
reality of between 30 to 40 violent incidents every
day — shootings, bombings, ambushes and killings. It
is perpetrated by suicide bombers who have no respect
for life, either their own or that of others. The only
place they can be intercepted is at the point from which
they depart.
Israel is, by definition, an experienced member of
the anti-terror camp. We know that terror can never win
if people protect and preserve their fundamental
security. Terror is strong as long as anti-terror is weak
and terror is frightening as long as people are afraid of
it. Terror basically represents cowardliness and does
not serve any real purpose. Terror neither follows
justice nor serves goals. It is not a remedy; it is a
malady.
12

We are at a juncture. The world is pursuing new
opportunities and frontiers. No longer will it be a world
divided between developed and underdeveloped
nations, black and white or men and women. It will
become a world where every person will have access to
knowledge and opportunity to participate in the new
genesis. States have become weaker economically and
strategically because economy and strategy have
themselves become global. Yet we do not have
organized world institutions to secure the globe and
distribute wealth more justly.
Two courses are open to every State: either to
join the new economy or to submit to old terror; the
creation of wealth or the threat of death. Each must
make its own choice between the promise of economy
or protest by terror. The Global Compact initiated by
the Secretary-General offers us a road map to the
former. It defines the functions and contributions of the
United Nations and imposes responsibilities on all of
us — nation States, the private sector and civil society.
It provides us with hope that, even as crises exist,
obscuring the opportunities just visible from the corner
of our eyes, the path to progress is clear to all with the
courage to embrace it.
We woke up to the twenty-first century with such
optimism. We must overcome the dangers so that our
children will again be raised in a world of almost
limitless opportunities. It can be done. We have learned
in Jerusalem that we can make a promised land into a
land of promise for all of us.





"
3,1993,"ISR_prev_1998","I should like to congratulate you,
Mr. President, on your unanimous election to preside over
the forty-eighth session of the United Nations General
Assembly.
We feel strongly that the time has come for all of us -
communities, nations, peoples, families - finally to lay the
last collective wreath on the tombs of the fallen combatants
and on the monuments of our beloved. It is the right way to
honour their memories and to answer the needs of the newly
born. We have to lay the foundations for a new Middle
East.
The peace agreement between us and the Palestinians
is not just an accord signed by political leaders. It is an
ongoing, profound commitment to the next generation of
Arabs and Israelis, Christians, Muslims, Jews and people of
all other faiths.
We know it is not enough to declare an end to war.
We have to try to eradicate the roots of all hostilities. If we
only bring violence down but ignore misery, we may
discover that we have traded one menace for another peril.
Territorial disputes may have been the reason for wars
between nations, and poverty may again become the seed of
violence between peoples. While signing the documents on
the lawn of the White House, I could almost sense the
breeze of a fresh spring, and my imagination began to
wander to the skies of our land, which may have become
brighter to the eyes of all people, both those who agree and
those who oppose. On the lawn one could almost hear the
heavy tread of boots leaving the stage after a hundred years
of hostility. One could have heard the gentle tiptoeing of
new steps making a debut in a world awaiting peace.
Yet we could not depart from reality. I know that the
solution to the Palestinian issue may be the key to a new
beginning, but it is in no way the answer to the many needs
awaiting us upon our return home.
The last decade saw great changes, including the end of
East-West confrontation and the opening of the way for the
gradual disappearance of North-South polarization. The
great continent of Asia and the picturesque continent of
South America introduced the dynamics of an economic
development of their own. The dramatic event in South
Africa is a declaration to the same effect. So, contrary to all
assumptions, it has been demonstrated that neither geography
nor race is a hindrance or an advantage to economic
promise.
We witnessed the end of some wars only to discover
that the warriors did not reach their own promised land.
Some colonized people gained their independence, but they
hardly enjoyed its fruits. The dangers may have been over,
but their hopes evaporated. We have learned that the end of
a war should be the beginning of a new genesis, which will
be the end of belligerency and will put an end to
psychological prejudices.
No nation, rich or poor, is able nowadays to attain
security unless the region in which it exists is secure. The
scope of regional security must exceed the range of ballistic
missiles, which may hit each and all of us.
As we strive to achieve a comprehensive peace, no
wound must remain unhealed.
Geographically speaking, we live side by side with the
Jordanian Kingdom, and what is so obvious geographically
must become clear politically. We have already agreed with
the Hashemite Kingdom on many complicated issues, and
there is no doubt that we can complete the story fully, that
we can offer the people on both sides of the river full peace,
that the Dead Sea can become a spring of new life and that
the old waters of the River Jordan can be a source of
prosperity flowing from each side to the other.
We hope - as a matter of fact, we are determined - to
make peace with Syria, yet we ask the Syrian leadership, if
it has chosen peace, why it refuses to meet openly. If Syria
is aiming for the Egyptian fruits of peace, it must follow the
process that led to them. Both of us have to look ahead and
realize that the threats of war are no more than an illusion
that one can return to an unbearable past.
We shall not give up our negotiations with our
Lebanese neighbours. We do not have any territorial claims
or any political pretensions concerning Lebanon. We pray,
together with many Lebanese, that their country will no
longer be a back yard for troublemakers. It is for Lebanon
to make a choice between Hizbollah, on the one hand, which
operates from its territory and then takes orders from another
Government, and, on the other, insisting on having one
army, one policy, and offering real tranquillity to its people
and security to its neighbours. Lebanon does not need a
license to regain its independence, and Lebanon should not
postpone its return to its balanced, traditional policy.
I am not sure whether there is a new order in the
world, but all of us feel there is a new world awaiting an
order. We are encouraged by the new attempt of the United
Nations and its Secretary-General to answer the social and
22 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
economic call of the present era. The United Nations was
created as a political answer; today it must face social and
economic questions.
The Middle East, which has been an important agenda
item in United Nations history, must become prosperous, not
only peaceful. To construct a modern Middle East we need
wisdom no less than financial support.
We have to rid ourselves of the costly follies of the
past and adopt the principles of modern economy. Who
will, and who should, pay the cost of oversized armies?
Who will, and who should, bear the price of an arms race
whose cost has reached $50 billion annually? Who will, and
who should, pay for the inefficiencies of old systems? Who
will, and who should, compensate for outmoded censorship
of mail and control of trade and travel? And who will
comply with the State where suspicion intercepts the
enterprising spirit of the people?
We can, and we should, turn to the promises of
scientific development, the market economy and
comprehensive education. We must base our industry,
agriculture and services on the highest of today’s
technologies. We have to invest in our schools. Israel, a
country of immigration, is blessed with many scientists and
engineers. We shall gladly make this human wealth
available as a contribution.
I know that there is suspicion; that, when referring to
a common market in the Middle East or announcing an
Israeli contribution, it may be perceived as an attempt to win
preference or to establish domination. May I say sincerely
and loudly that we did not give up territorial control to
engage ourselves in economic superiority. The age of
domination, political or economic, is dead. The time of
cooperation has begun.
As a Jew, may I say that the virtue and the essence of
our history since the times of Abraham and the
commandments of Moses have been an uncompromising
opposition to any form of occupation, domination and
discrimination. For us, Israel is not just a territorial
homeland, but a permanent moral commitment as well.
There are other questions, concerning the building of a
common market in the Middle East, as to how to attain this
when governments are so varied and economies are so
different. The differences in governments and economies
should not prevent us from doing together what can be done
together: combating the desert and offering fertility to an
arid land.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations declared that the Middle East must double its
agricultural production in the 25 years to come. The
population of the region in the same period will double itself
anyway. The land is cut by many and large deserts and its
water resources are stingy and scarce. Yet we know that in
a similar period of time - the 25 years between 1950 and 1975 -
Israel was able to increase its agricultural output twelvefold -
an increase unprecedented in history.
During the past decade, 95 per cent of the growth of
our agriculture resulted from research, planning, training and
organizing. High technology permits nations to attain real
independence and to experience genuine freedom, political
as well as economic. There is nothing new about the
scarcity of water in our midst. Jacob and Esau drank from
the same wells even when their paths were separated. But
then, unlike today, they could not desalinate the sea water;
they could not computerize irrigation; nor could they enjoy
the potential of biotechnology.
We are meeting again with an entirely different
opportunity. Greening the land can be accompanied by the
creation of many new jobs for all people in the area. The
most promising opportunity may be the development of
tourism. No other branch of modern industry assures an
immediate growth of the Middle East like this one. Our area
is blessed by nature and by history, a history which is still
very much alive: the eternity of Jerusalem, the magnificence
of the pyramids, the symbols of Luxor, the Hanging Gardens
of Babylon, the Pillars of Wisdom in Baalbek, the red
palaces of Petra, the inimitable charm of Marakesh, the old
winds which still blow in Carthage, not forgetting the
beaches of Gaza or the scent of Jericho’s perfumed fruits.
We have to open roads to those wonders and keep them safe
and hospitable. Tourism depends on tranquility; tourism
enhances tranquillity. It makes friendship a vested interest.
Thirdly, we have to build an infrastructure with modern
means so as to avoid the pitfalls of the past. Modern
transportation and revolutionary communications crossing the
air, covering the ground and connecting the seas will turn
geographical proximities into an economic advantage. We
should not ask taxpayers of other countries to finance follies
of our own. We have to correct them ourselves. We do not
have the moral right to ask for the financing of unnecessary
wars or wasteful systems.
If the thumping of hammers replaces the thunder of
guns, many nations will be more than willing to extend a
helping hand. They will invest in a better future. They will
support the replacement of unwarranted confrontation with
Forty-eighth session - 28 September l993 23
much-needed economic competition. Markets can serve the
needs of the people no less than flags can signify their
destinies. The time has come to build a Middle East for the
people and not just for the rulers.
It was not simple to open the locked doors to peace. In
the name of God, let them not be closed again. Let peace
be comprehensive, embracing all issues, all countries, all
generations. We suggest that we all negotiate together as
equals. We offer a common ground of mutual respect and
mutual compromise. Thirteen years have passed since we
made peace with Egypt. We are grateful to Egypt and its
President for expanding understanding, overt and hidden. In
a world in which so many insoluble problems reside, the
Palestinians and we have finally shown that in fact there are
no insoluble problems, only people who tend to believe that
many problems are insoluble.
We have negotiated one of the most complicated issues
of the last 100 years. We are grateful to the United States
for its support and leadership. We are grateful to both
President Clinton and Secretary Christopher for their crucial
role. We appreciate the Egyptian role and the Norwegian
encouragement; the European involvement and serious
contribution; the Asian support and blessing. Maybe we
now have the right to say to other people in conflict: ""Do
not give up. Do not surrender to old obsessions and do not
take fresh disappointments at face value."" What we did,
others can do as well.
We are determined to make the agreement with the
Palestinians into a permanent success. Israel would consider
the economic success of the Palestinians as though it were
its own, and I believe that a newly achieved security will
serve the aspirations of the Israelis and the necessities of the
Palestinians.
Gaza, after 7,000 years of suffering, can emancipate
itself from want. Jericho, without its fallen walls, can see its
gardens blossom again.
As the twentieth century comes to a close, we have
learned from the United States and Russia that there are no
military answers to the new military dangers, only political
solutions. Successful economies are no longer a monopoly
of the rich and the mighty. They represent an open
invitation to every nation ready to adopt the combination of
science and open-mindedness. We see at the end of this
century that politics can achieve more by good will than by
power, and that the young generation watching their
televisions compare their lot with the fortunes or misfortunes
of others. They see freedom, they watch peace, they view
prosperity, all in real time. They know that they can attain
more if they work harder.
If we want to represent their hopes, we have to
combine wise policies and regional security with market
economies. Historically we were born equal, and equally we
can give birth to a new age.

So said the Prophet."
3,1994,"ISR_prev_1998","I should like to congratulate
you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General
Assembly. We are pleased that the representative of Côte
d’Ivoire - a nation for which Israel has high regard - has
been elected to this distinguished post. I should like to
express to the Secretary General our deepest appreciation
13


for his contribution to world peace in general, and to peace
in the Middle East in particular.
A year ago, I offered a concept for a new Middle
East. Many applauded; more remained sceptical. What at
that time seemed lofty is today a reality. I feel I can
submit today an invitation to a further journey in the new
Middle East.
Last year was a year of remarkable events. The
Palestinian people, as a result of our agreement, gained
authority in Gaza and Jericho; Jordan and Israel agreed, in
the Washington Declaration, to end the state of war and
move towards an agreement of full peace; voices of
promise are exchanged between Damascus and Jerusalem;
multilateral meetings produced a network of regional
cooperation; Morocco and Israel established formal
relations; and an agenda for a new Middle East will emerge
from an unprecedented economic conference in Casablanca
next month.
The desire for peace is rooted in the millenniums of
Jewish existence. Generations prayed for it, and now a
young generation in Israel is today engaged in making it.
The search for peace is shared by young people all over the
Middle East, Arabs and Israelis alike. We have to fulfil
their hope.
I am addressing this Assembly for the first time, not
as a party to a controversy, but as a representative of a
country that has shown a capacity to solve conflicts that
seemed insoluble.
The United Nations should play an increasing role
facing the changing times. It can define new destinies. It
can adopt new means.
As the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth
anniversary, it may adopt models for new endeavours by
mobilizing builders to construct peace, not just by
deploying troops to keep it. Economic structures will offer
more than military deployment.
Gaza, as an example, has a new authority. It needs a
new economy. The United Nations can provide an answer.
The 7,000 years of Gaza are mainly a history of suffering.
Its population density today is among the highest in the
world.
There is a role for the United Nations in Gaza, and it
has played one. It began by stationing troops - which were
recalled, unfortunately, on the eve of the Six-Day War.
Then UNRWA came and supplied food, health and
education to the refugees. Then UNDP contributed
greatly to the construction of an infrastructure in the Gaza
Strip.
The United Nations can help Gaza today become
free from want. It can introduce there the necessary
economic and proper social institutions. An enlarged
allocation for Gaza, with the existing United Nations
administration, will produce immediate results and may
make Gaza a new model of United Nations endeavours.
The world is moving from military might to social
priorities. It is time to turn from political confrontation
to economic cooperation. In the Middle East, economic
growth can compensate for political compromises.
We no longer live in a closed world. The intensive
flow of information has opened the eyes of many people.
No longer can tyranny blind their perceptions. Iron
curtains can no longer bar the spread of the true story.
Knowledge has finally overcome propaganda.
This current is profound and lasting. The sources of
strength and wealth are today universal rather than
national, intellectual rather than material. The size of the
territory, the number of its people, the wealth of its raw
materials, no longer decide the fate of a nation. It is the
scope of education, the level of science, applied
technology and up-to-date information that make all the
difference.
Intellectual sources are no longer partitioned by
traditional divides. Science has no territorial limits.
Technology has no national flags. Information can travel
without visas. Armies cannot conquer wisdom. Borders
cannot protect knowledge. The talent of creation is
replacing the strategies of destruction. Computers, not
rifles, mark the difference. The hunting season in history
is disappearing.

This does not mean an end to agonies. Starvation,
disease, terrorism, desertification, nuclear weapons,
ecological damage and dangerous drugs overflow the
boundaries of land and the boundaries of reason.
Violence employs new tactics: it has not
disappeared. Confrontations in the future may not
necessarily be wars of conquest, but bloodshed of protest.
14


The strong know that they will not be strengthened by
dominating the poor, or by owning their deserts. The poor
cannot, and will not, comply with their conditions, tolerated
by the indifference of the well-off.
Existing institutions were initiated in a different time.
They are based today on memories rather than on needs.
Ministries of foreign affairs and defence were structured to
confront enemies. Now we face dangers more than
enemies, but without our being organized to handle them.
We are not answering the need. Diplomacy and strategy
should be mobilized to face the undefined dangers. Disease
will not be overcome by traditional diplomatic démarches.
Starvation cannot be eliminated by guns. Deserts will not
bloom beneath air raids. Remedies will not arrive of their
own accord: they should be invented and introduced.
Israel is on the side of this tendency. We are
committed to ending the conflicts. We are determined to
uproot their causes. We do not intend to stop this
momentum or allow its interruption.
For the last five decades the mere existence of Israel
has served as a temptation to try and destroy it. For half a
century we had to give security top priority. To this very
day, we shed tears on the tombs of our children, who paid
with their young lives to overcome the menace. When
wars became futile, suspicion succeeded fighting. The
allegation was that Israel was trying to expand territorially
and was unwilling to compromise geographically. Reality
ended this allegation as well.
Egypt, first to negotiate peace, found an Israel willing
to exchange land for peace. The Palestinians, next in line,
gained jurisdiction over territories they had never controlled
before. With Jordan, we agreed to delineate a permanent
border without one side encroaching on the land of the
other. Syria was told at the outset of negotiations that the
nature of peace would affect the depth of the withdrawal.
Lebanon was told that Israel had no demands on its
territory and no intention of compromising its integrity.
Negotiations have not been easy. With the
Palestinians, we negotiated on uncharted ground. Never
had the Palestinian people experienced self-rule. Today
they possess a territorial address and an administrative
authority. For the first time in their history, their children’s
education is solely in Palestinian hands. In the coming days
Israel will hand over additional responsibilities to the
Palestinian Authority. The Declaration of Principles will be
fully implemented in the spirit and letter. We shall support
a Palestinian readiness to hold democratic elections.
Israel, as well as the Palestinians, may discover that
Palestinian democracy and Israeli security are
complementary. We have demonstrated that we are true
in our moral choice not to govern the destiny of another
people.
We shall continue to negotiate with Syria. We are
negotiating out of conviction, not weakness, and we hope
to conclude the negotiations with a settlement that will
respect the interests of both sides, without harming Syrian
dignity or compromising Israeli security. Syria insists on
a narrow path for the negotiations, postponing meetings
between the leaders and thus slowing the pace of
negotiations. Israel is ready for accelerated negotiations.
We address the Syrians by saying: ""Let us talk face to
face. Let us negotiate, as proclaimed in Damascus, with
courage to attain a peace of honour. By ending suspicion,
introducing creativity and allowing flexibility, we can
transform a promising climate into a solid terrain."" Syria
declared its strategy for peace. We appreciate it.
Military threats and territorial positions should be
transformed by security arrangements, diplomatic rapport,
full peace and economic endeavours. That will erode the
motivation for conflict. Without peaceful relations,
balances of power are meaningless. The range of
understanding can serve as the only answer to the range
of ballistic missiles.
President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher
are relentlessly pushing for peace. European, Russian and
many other leaders are genuinely supportive. Important
Middle Eastern leaders are actively engaged in the same
direction. Still, much depends on direct negotiations.
Yesterday’s enemies, tomorrow’s partners, should become
today’s interlocutors.
A peace treaty between Israel and Syria may
produce a historic result greater than just an agreement
between two countries. It may well become the crowning
of a comprehensive peace. It may become an opportunity
for the leaders of the region - Kings, Presidents, Prime
Ministers, supported by the most prominent leaders of our
time - to gather and announce the end of the conflict and
to proclaim full peace throughout the region.
Peace can hardly emerge from stinginess. By
definition, it calls for generosity. Peace is more than a
mere ceremony. It requires ongoing maintenance; it
awaits a passionate cultivation of new relations. We hope
that our neighbours, from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon, from
Djibouti to Algeria, will become constructive partners in
15


it. Dark clouds are still hanging over the horizon - the
shadows of missed opportunities.
We have to build a coalition to prevent subversive
turbulence from undermining legitimate Governments and
harassing the stability needed for the inflow of investment.
All countries of the Middle East face a choice: to remain
politically divided and economically stagnant or to become
economically advanced and politically just.
A high standard of living for the people - all people -
is the best promise for stability in our midst. Israel is
willing to participate in achieving it. There are sceptics, we
know, who do not believe that the Middle East is ripe for
a common market similar to the European one. They forget
that Europe did not do it in one leap. It started with a
Community of coal and steel. We can start with a
community of water and tourism.
Nor do they believe that the Middle East is ready for
a free trade zone like the one in North America. Yet the
North American Free Trade Agreement emerged in a short
while as a success by linking geographic proximity with
economic growth. Those sceptics claim that generations are
needed to cement a new market in the Middle East. Well,
they can see what in 10 short years happened to Asian
countries, which attained unpredicted prosperity. They
achieved it by adopting a market economy.
The profile of a market economy is clear. It is made
of comprehensive education, open borders, free movement,
science-based industries and competitive trade. A market
economy is a fabric woven from political silk and durable
threads of welfare. The time is ripe for its rendezvous with
the Middle East.
At the end of October, under the presidency of King
Hassan II, we shall take the first step to implement a
regional design. We shall try to establish instruments for
development: a regional bank, channels for private
investment and a framework for regional planning. The
wealth of the Middle East should be convinced to remain
at home. Over the last decade it has invested the better
part of its fortunes abroad. Homebound wealth will attract
foreign investment as well.
We should cut the enormous expense - $70 billion
annually - of the arms race. The savings can be directed to
development. The arms race can be reduced only by
regional consent. No single country will do it alone.
To transform the region and make it a stable and
attractive place we need the emergence of the region as
a whole, committed to a new future. Nature, and not
only politics, calls for it. The waters, the winds, the
environment call for regional responsibility and
cooperation, for desalinization plants, energy stations,
highways, railways, runways, piers, telecommunication
networks, high-tech industries, tourism infrastructure,
banking systems, computer terminals and ecological
considerations - a landscape that will meet the future will
create a state of prosperity, and it is a regional challenge.
The Middle East was the cradle of civilization and
has a capacity to contribute. It experienced golden ages,
economically and culturally. It should be our collective
ambition to make it happen again and to make it happen
soon. Today, shortages can be bridged rapidly.
Computers can carry children not only from grade to
grade but from age to age. The software of knowledge
will better replace the hardware of weapons.
I have served my country since its birth. I have
learned that complex problems call for unconventional
solutions. I feel that over the past year we have won a
licence to build a new Middle East, to make it part of the
globe in its new age, free of wars, free of enemies, free
of terrorism; a Middle East which will be nuclear-free,
missile-free, hunger-free, discrimination-free, tyranny-free;
a constituency of peace, a domain of freedom, a land of
prosperity. There is a morning awaiting us after a long
night, calling us to direct our energies and our aims and
our prayers towards that great opportunity."
3,1992,"ISR_prev_1998","Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, and 
the nation of Bulgaria, on your assumption of the presidency of the United 
Nations General Assembly. May I also congratulate the Secretary-General, 
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, on his leadership in the struggle for peace. I wish him 
success in his endeavours. 
Today I speak for an Israel that has chosen to step out of the shadows of 
the past to prepare for the invitation of a new future. The world is alive 
with the impulse for change. The end of conflict is no longer a Utopian 

fantasy. It is the dictate of realism and of universal self-interest. We 
look to the future in a world that wants peace. 
Like a hidden Samson, the forces of change have pushed aside the pillars 
of conventional wisdom, which proclaimed that military power is the source of 
national strength and prestige. This is no longer true. The cost of 
maintaining a significantly large army can deplete the resources of the 
richest countries, even if the weaponry remains unused. Around our changing 
world, the flow of knowledge has superseded military might as the source of 
real strength and social stability. 

The flow of knowledge no longer stops at national frontiers. It is not 
possible in the age of modern communications to shield peoples from truth and 
reality. Eventually, even dictators must face the fact that the best censors 
cannot block the free flow of ideas. But knowledge cannot be acquired without 
the right to doubt, the readiness to change. Knowledge is not available 
without freedom, and so democracy is prevailing throughout the world. 
In this new era, the era of knowledge, the governing principles are those 
of democratic structures, market-based economies, open borders, demilitarized 
international and regional relations, and respect for human rights. But while 
all nations should embrace these new principles, national traditions and 
identities retain their power. Nation-States will remain the focus of 
allegiance and social pride. 
To reconcile national identity, regional cooperation and universal 
solidarities is the central issue of contemporary life. 
The United Nations was established in an era that no longer exists. Yet 
its ideals and structures can meet the challenges and dangers of this new 
age. We support the ""Agenda for Peace"" offered by the Secretary-General. We 
support and will participate in the attempt to build a global protection 
system. 
The United Nations must be the headquarters for an all-embracing struggle 
to safeguard the environment against new threats. It must be a powerhouse to 
arrest starvation. It must develop the institutions and the ability to 
intervene when necessary to stop otherwise insoluble civil wars. The United 
Nations must reorganize to face these problems in a global capacity. 
In our own region, we must understand that even if our geography and 
people have not changed, the world has changed. No longer can we live on 

disappearing premises. For generations, the conflicts in the Middle East were 
nurtured by global conflicts by the cold war and hot competition. Within 
the context of super-Power rivalry, the belligerents in the Middle East were 
generously supplied with shining armour. But where there were once evil 
empires, we now see only the desire for a peaceful world. Russia has 
changed. The United States has emerged from the cold war with renewed respect 
from the world for its democratic drive for peace. The third world is 
changing, with many nations ending old hostilities and building new 
economies. In Africa, the forces of racism are being gradually driven out. 
In the Middle East itself let's face it the peace between Israel and Egypt 
is attaining the respect of age. There is a fresh atmosphere in our time. 
The time is now upon us for the nations of the Middle East to come to 
terms with the new realities, to make a living on their own. We can learn to 
benefit from peaceful coexistence. If we are to survive, we must understand 
that the dangers and opportunities we face are regional rather than national. 
In an age of long-range missiles, national defence must be a collective 
effort. To provide our people with modern standards of living we must have 
open borders and mutually beneficial exchanges. 
For too long the Middle East has been caught up in national conflicts and 
national rivalries for the glorification of national leaders. We need to 
build a new Middle East of, by and for the people. In our effort to build 
this new future for the Middle East, Israel does not ignore its still existing 
disagreements with our neighbours. The record shows that we are working to 
solve them humanely, honourably and, wherever possible, permanently. We are 
currently engaged in bilateral negotiations to bring an end to the conflicts 
of the past and multilateral negotiations to lay the foundation for the future. 

In the bilateral negotiations, we are negotiating with the Jordanians, 
the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese. The committed leadership of 
the United States has played a central role in bringing all the parties into 
face-to-face negotiations. 
With the Jordanians, the solutions are awaiting the parties. We face 
common problems we must confront together, including the possible Jordanian 
connection to Palestinian self-government and beyond. Our relations with the 
Hashemite Kingdom have seen open hostilities but also tacit efforts to 
overcome these hostilities. We look forward to a complete peace with the 
Kingdom of Jordan in the near future. 
With the Palestinian people, our conflict has been long and painful. We 
seek to end this conflict. We are looking for a bridge to cross the gulf of 
bitter memories, painful hatreds and emotion-laden suspicions. We have 
offered to negotiate an interim or transitional goal. There is no difference 
between the two. In fact, one can note with satisfaction that the 
Palestinians have agreed to this gradual approach. The direction is clear, 
even if the bridge will be built slowly. 
The suggested path is an interim self-government arrangement, as 
conceived at Camp David. We know that this proposal is imperfect in some 
respects. Self-government is less than independence. But it offers the 
flexibility of an arrangement that will last no more than five years. During 
this limited period of time, Palestinians in the territories will enjoy 
self-government. The opportunity to select, through democratic political 
elections, a Palestinian administrative council will enable the Palestinian 
people to exercise a double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern their 
own lives and to do so politically and democratically. 

But instead of attempting to draw a map of a self-governing territory 
and it is doubtful that this could be achieved now we have suggested a 
definite timetable. So, while this proposal lacks the clarity of a map, it 
provides the commitment of a calendar. This proposal is clearly a departure 
from the present situation. It has the dynamics of a voyage to a new destiny, 
a bridge which begins at one shore and reaches another. 
I know it will not be an easy choice for either side. But neither the 
existing situation nor the foreseeable future contains a more promising 
alternative. I am speaking for an Israeli Government that has firmly made up 
its mind and seeks the expeditious implementation of this proposal. 
In negotiations, the parties tend to scrutinize every letter, every dot. 
I hope that the Palestinians will also perceive the spirit of our intent, 
which is to extricate ourselves from the position of domination over another 
people. We have never in our history as a people sought domination over 
others. We wholeheartedly seek a future where the children of both peoples 
will escape the agonies of a distorted past and live under a clear sky of 
security and hope. 

With the Syrians, we have begun a dialogue in full daylight for the first 
time in 44 years. It is necessary now to translate the change in the mood 
between our two nations into viable and carefully constructed accords 
expressing a mutual interest in security and cooperation. 
We call for a departure from old dogmas and all-embracing dictates, and 
we hope the Syrians will adopt the same approach. We understand the need to 
safeguard the security and freedom of both nations, theirs and ours. It is 
our responsibility to ensure that those who have survived the wars of the past 
will have the opportunity to open a new peaceful chapter in the history of the 
two peoples. 
The leaders of both countries should be directly involved in these 
negotiations, which are in need of a new approach and creative thinking. I 
call on the President of Syria to set aside his reservations and meet with the 
Prime Minister of Israel. 
We have made clear to the Syrians that Security Council resolutions 
242 (1967) and 338 (1973) contain a territorial dimension, combined with other 
components of peace and security which must be equally respected. 
We believe in a comprehensive solution involving all issues and all 
parties. Yet we do not consider it wise to link one negotiation to another, 
or to postpone an agreement with one country because of delays elsewhere. One 
negotiating process should not be handcuffed to another. 
With respect to Lebanon, Israel holds no territorial claims; nor does it 
seek to influence the political destiny of that country. We recall peaceful 
relations with Lebanon at a time when it was internally balanced and 
tranquil. We hope that such a time will return again. The moment Lebanon 
finds peace within itself and independence from outside intervention, Lebanon 
and Israel will live in peace again. 

Looking at the bilateral negotiations, we recall that the success of our 
negotiations with Egypt stemmed from dialogue at many levels of society: 
decision makers, leaders, businessmen, academicians. We appeal to all our 
Arab neighbours to establish the same dialogue today. There is no room for 
timidity, reluctance or boycotts in a peace process. Peacemaking should not 
be a hideaway operation. 
I hope our neighbours realize that Israel has implemented unilateral 
confidence-building measures. We have drastically changed our settlement 
policies, altered our policies towards the Palestinian people, offered new 
proposals for self-government and suggested target dates for the 
implementation of this process. We have done these things unconditionally. 
Yet confidence-building measures call for reciprocity. We seek an end to the 
unjustified economic boycott and the cessation of terror. 
We shall not allow ourselves or our adversaries to escape this chance for 
peace. Yet we cannot turn our region into a new Middle East by just 
negotiating old disputes. Our new challenges are on our horizons, not only in 
our frontiers. 
We say to our Arab neighbours: the real danger is not Israel. The real 
danger is poverty. The real danger is poverty that creates protest, even if 
it is occasionally cloaked in a religious mantle. Poverty and protest 
endanger both the Arab nations and Israel. Israel does not want to become an 
isolated island in an ocean of resentment. 
Two hundred forty million people live today in the Middle East. The 
majority of them live in a state of want. In 30 years, there will be 
500 million people in the region, two thirds residing in Africa, one third in 
Asia. 
 
The poverty of the Middle East has nothing to do with geography. It has 
to do with the use and misuse of available and potential resources in the 
region. The gap between wealthy and poor nations is wide: the more 
prosperous nations enjoy a per capita income 10 times greater than their 
poorer neighbours. The earth beneath us will continue to tremble if the 
wealthy remain oblivious to the needy, both within and beyond national borders. 
The multilateral negotiations are composed of five areas: economics, 
arms control, refugees, ecology and water. Progress in these areas will more 
likely be attained if we can restructure the multilateral talks, which 
initially created two advantages: the cluster of issues and the participation 
of many Arab countries. But the talks suffer as well from loose organization, 
which has resulted in seminars rather than negotiations, and from the lack of 
a concentrated thrust to coordinate their work. We suggest the following 
changes. 
First, the separate negotiations should be conducted in a coordinated 
manner. 
Secondly, participation in the steering committee should be raised to the 
ministerial level. 
Thirdly, the multilateral negotiations should be intensified through more 
frequent meetings for longer periods of time. 
Fourthly, the Syrians and the Lebanese should participate. 
Fifthly, discussion of human rights and pluralistic values should be made 
part of the talks so as to combine the discussion of well-defined practical 
issues with the pursuit of common values very much akin to the Helsinki 
accords. 

And finally, the parties should agree not to postpone progress in the 
multilateral talks until the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations. Early 
planning can save crucial time for all parties without forcing irreversible 
commitments. And lost time cannot be regained. 
The bilateral negotiations are essentially political. The multilateral 
negotiations are essentially economic. We live in an age when financial 
assistance in itself is no longer the answer to the economic needs of the 
Middle East. In the past, belligerency created dependence upon the financial 
assistance of other nations. By diminishing the need for arms and building 
the right economic structure, we will be able create wealth of our own. There 
is no need to impoverish the wealthy in order to enrich the poor. Opening 
borders, paving roads, introducing modern communications, and exchanging 
technology will generate economic growth in the Middle East. 
Trade across borders is essential for economic growth. Markets transcend 
national boundaries. Water, tourism and commerce do not subjugate themselves 
to political maps. The Middle East should follow the example of the ""seven 
tigers"" in Asia, the European Common Market and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. Let us understand: these regions are our competitors and they are 
far ahead of the Middle East in facing the new realities of the international 
economy. We have to build an open regional economy, for the same reasons and 
with the same promise that led others to do so. We have to build a common 
market in the Middle East. 
 
We have to set out upon the long and complicated road to arms control. 
That we can learn from the East-West negotiations and other attempts at arms 
control. We have to follow the patient path of confidence-building measures 
in the geographical and technical domains until we are able to rid the Middle 
East of the terror presented by weapons of mass destruction, both conventional 
and non-conventional. Israel has proposed the creation of a nuclear-free zone 
in the Middle East numerous times, and we stand ready to pursue this goal 
today. 
We should address the problems of refugees, not by threatening to destroy 
the existing demographic balance, but by exploring a range of possibilities 
for restoring the dignity of refugees and offering them a new life. 
We should act to save our fresh air and historic landscape. Ecological 
pollution does not respect borders, and so we have to marshal forces to save 
our region from the danger of uncontrolled deterioration. 
Finally, the Middle East possesses vast desert land but meagre water 
resources. The land is static, the population is increasing and water 
resources are declining. Available water should be reused, and new fresh 
water produced from the sea. Either the land will be salinized by the sea or 
the sea water will be desalinized through available technology. The 
technology is available, and the necessary credit is attainable. We can 
satisfy the needs of man and land. The Middle East can be made green. It 
depends upon us. 
Here, I believe, are the pillars of wisdom for a new Middle East: 
economic growth, arms control, dignity for the refugees, environmental 
protection and water resources, coupled with religious freedom, pluralistic 
values and human rights. The nations of the Middle East must work 
individually and collectively to meet these challenges of a changed world. 

The agenda is ambitious. Is it merely a dream? No. It is a blueprint, 
and the necessary elements are within our grasp. Will these goals be achieved 
in our lifetime? We dare not hesitate, because the world will not wait for 
the Middle East. We are tragically late in making peace. If we do not face 
our economic challenges, we will be left hopelessly far behind. 
The agenda is new. The vision was already mentioned in Proverbs: 
""Wisdom builds the house. 
""Good judgment makes it secure."" (The Holy Bible. Proverbs 24:3) 
""Wisdom prevails over strength; knowledge over brute force."" (The Holy 
Bible. Proverbs 24:5) 
We have to go to work. For us, the Jewish people, this is Rosh Hashanah, 
the New Year. We pray that the year to come will bring peace, freedom and 
prosperity to build a new Middle East for all of its people Muslim, 
Christian, Jewish, Arab, Israeli for us, and for our children."
3,1995,"ISR_prev_1998","I should like to congratulate Mr.
Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of the
General Assembly. We are glad that a representative of
Portugal, a nation for which Israel has high regard, was
elected to that distinguished post.
I would like to express to the Secretary-General, Mr.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, a man of our region and a man of
peace, our deepest appreciation for his contribution to world
peace in general and to the Middle East peace in particular.
Tomorrow, the Jewish people will pray on the day of
Yom Ha-Kippurim:
(spoke in Hebrew; English text furnished by the delegation)
“In the Book of Life: blessings, peace, a good
livelihood, good decrees, salvation and consolation.
May you be remembered and inscribed.”
(spoke in English)
We pray for all humanity, for the whole world.
For us, the United Nations is not just a place of prayer
and surely not a platform for speeches. We come here to
state our convictions and to announce our commitments. In
our address in 1987, I stated on behalf of the State of
Israel:
“We have found President Mubarak of Egypt to
be a builder of a better life for his people and of
bridges for a comprehensive peace in the region.”
(Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-
second Session, Plenary Meetings, 17th meeting,
p. 23-25)
Today, under the leadership of President Mubarak,
Egypt is becoming a centre for regional development on the
way to hosting the first regional bank of development.
In the same address, we stated:
“An international conference is the door to direct
negotiations. Once convened it should lead
immediately to face-to-face bilateral negotiations.”
(Ibid., p. 26)
On 30 October, 1991, the Madrid Conference took place.
In 1992, again we declared:
“The opportunity to select, through democratic
political elections, the Palestinian administrative
council will enable the Palestinian people to exercise
a double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern
their own lives and to do so ... democratically.”
(Ibid., Forty-seventh Session, Plenary Meetings,
20th meeting, p. 48)
Last week, we achieved what we promised.
Lastly, in 1993, we declared again from this rostrum:
“Geographically speaking, we live side by side
with the Jordanian Kingdom, and what is so obvious
geographically must become clear politically [so
that] we can offer the people of both sides of the
river full peace, that the Dead Sea can become a
spring of new life.” (Ibid., Forty-eighth Session,
Plenary Meetings, 6th meeting, p. 22)
In October 1994, just one year later, Jordan and Israel
signed a peace treaty.
Last year, we said here:
“All countries of the Middle East face a choice:
to remain politically divided and economically
stagnant or to become economically advanced and
politically just.
“... We shall try to establish instruments for
development: a regional bank, channels for private
investment and a framework for regional planning.”
(Ibid., Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings,
10th meeting, p. 16)
In October 1994, the first Middle East-North African
economic summit was held in Casablanca under the
splendid presidency of His Majesty King Hassan II. At
the end of this month, a second summit will be held in
Amman under the auspices of His Majesty King Hussein.
At the end of November, the first ground-breaking Euro-
Mediterranean conference will be held in Barcelona.
Three years, five promises: all of them fulfilled. I
would like to use this occasion to turn to the Syrians and
to turn to the Lebanese and ask them to stop hesitating,
to stop wandering. They have to look at this record and
come in and follow up. The President of Syria has said
that from experience he has learned that only through
military negotiations and making security the major
agenda item can one achieve peace. Sorry: Experience has
4


shown that through negotiation on all levels, embracing all
issues without timidity, without fatigue, we can achieve
peace. If leaders meet and are not successful at the first
meeting, they will have another meeting. How can it be
wrong for them to work day and night, ceaselessly, with
new ideas and new approaches? They are not wasting the
leaders’ time; they are wasting the time of the people —
their fortunes, their happiness, opportunities for the younger
generation.
We also tell all the countries of the Middle East, not
that we want to have a new Middle East, but that we want
the Middle East to join in a new age — for the good of
their people, not for the good of Israel. Israel is in good
shape because we are no longer living in a world where
there are empires of power and colonies of poverty. Poverty
and oppression are home-made, not imposed by others. The
choice is before every country to become free and
prosperous and democratic, like so many nations have done
in a relatively short time in Asia, Latin America and in
some countries of Africa. It is their choice, their
opportunity not just to build a different world but to
introduce the new world to their own people.
For us, the United States is not an empire of power.
We are not afraid of the United States. For us, the United
States is an empire of peace. We need the United States.
For us, Russia is going through a process of change. Russia
will remain great but will become something different. For
us, we welcome the European contribution to other
countries east and south of them and the convening of the
Barcelona conference to offer the Mediterranean peoples
funds and experience to build a new life. We are glad that
Japan is expanding its economic horizons and understanding
and contributing so that other nations can do so. And we
hope that other well-to-do countries in the Middle East,
including Arab countries, will help the needy parts of our
own region.
May I say that in my best judgement the greatest
danger is a combination of high technology and deep
hatred, of modern instruments and feudalistic views, and
the greatest hope for all of us is a double effort to respect
human values and modern education.
Israel itself is in good shape. We are strong militarily:
I do not deny it. We have an excellent economy — an
economy of brains, not of material resources. We have
absorbed a very large immigration of white and black Jews,
white Jews from Russia and black Jews from Ethiopia, and
nobody can understand what put Israel in such a relatively
good position.
What brought this about is, first of all, the return to
the moral choice. By the end of this year — at the latest
at the beginning of next year — not one Palestinian will
remain under our control. For the first time in the history
of the Palestinian people, they are educating their children
without intervention by us or anybody else. Nobody
forces us to do so. We are not weak. We are not poor.
We are not under pressure. We have had to take serious
risks because terror still continues. The Arab boycott is
still intact.
In our own country there is strong opposition to
what we are doing. We have had to spend a great part of
our budget to make peace — and yet, despite all this, we
decided to make a moral choice: not to dominate another
people. We stated in this Assembly that that was our
intention. Now we have done it and even politically, as
difficult as it may be at home — because, as a party, we
may win historically but we may also lose politically —
but then, winning peace is in our eyes more important
than winning elections. Why should you be elected if you
do not use the mandate of the people to change the course
of your history in a reasoned, moral way?
We believe that the strength of ethical judgement is
as important as military exercises or triumphs. We gave
up land and produced instead an economy of brains.
Today Israel is making out of its brains more than some
other countries in our vicinity are making out of oil.
And what we actually expect from the Palestinians
is for them to become democratic, to be prosperous, to
fight violence and terror, and we are giving our
neighbours a simple message: What we can do,
everybody can do.
For many years there was a legend that only the
North, which is white and wealthy and permanent, is a
success story, whereas the South is condemned to
backwardness, to poverty, to lagging behind. What has
happened in Asia, where the most vibrant economic
endeavours are taking place today, and what is happening
in Latin America show that the economy has nothing to
do with geographical location or the colour of the skin.
Make the right choice: serve your people and create a
new future.
What we are offering to anyone who is interested is
our experience — open, in a comradely way. We do not
want to dominate anybody and certainly not anybody’s
economy. We did not give up the domination of people
to gain domination of markets. And we are suggesting to
5


our neighbours — and we are happy that they have
accepted — is that the new frontiers — say, between
Jordan and Israel — will not be frontiers of mines and
hostile fences, but an occasion for joint ventures.
The whole rift of Africa, the whole valley which is a
desert that separates the Jordanians and us will become,
with God’s help, a source for work, for development. We
will build hotels and schools and desalination plants and
parks, and people will be free to move from one side to the
other, competing without hating, cooperating without
dominating.
We want to do the same about the dividing line
between us and the Palestinians: we want to build alongside
the line on the West Bank and Gaza eight industrial parks
so that the Palestinians will not have to cross the border
and go through Israel’s checkpoints: instead, work will
come to them, and together we shall invest and together we
shall develop.
A better economy is the best guarantee of peace.
Actually, there cannot be economic cooperation without
political understanding. Recently, while we were negotiating
we created three zones of security sensibility on the West
Bank — zone A, zone B and zone C. Then we turned to
water and electricity and we asked the water and the
current to submit to our political wisdom, but the electricity
and the water people said that they did not distinguish
between A, B and C. Water flows according to nature and
not according to artificial agreements, and electric current
does not stop at A or B or C. They serve everybody.
Today in the Middle East as elsewhere, the distinction
is no longer ideological or religious or national. There is
just one distinction between an old, poor, backward
economy and a new age where economies are based on
technology and science and where the natural resource is
schools for the children and not the mines of the Gulf.
Everybody can postpone the choice but nobody can escape
it.
Our aim is to have peace so as to serve our people; to
have education so as to equip our children to take
advantage of the new age, to be equal to others and to
compete with other children. It cannot remain a peace
between leaders: it must become a peace for the people,
now and in the future.
I started by showing what has happened in three or
four short years. It is a revolution. It is a beginning. We
should not stop in the middle. Let everybody pray to the
Lord in the language he is used to. Let everybody respect
his own tradition, his own heritage. Let everybody respect
the special experience of a people, of a nation. But let all
of us give up unnecessary hatred, untold suspicion. Let us
give up barricading ourselves behind old dogmas and
terrible prejudices. Let us help the people and the future.
Then the 50 years of the United Nations will offer not
just 50 years without war but the coming 50 years with
peace and prosperity."
3,2002,"ISR_post_1998","I would like to congratulate
my friend Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the
presidency of the General Assembly and to wish him
success. I also thank the Secretary-General for his
leadership and his dedication to right what is wrong
and to light the lamps of hope.
The eleventh of September gave rise to a new
world. We find ourselves facing a new confrontation:
borderless, merciless, indiscriminate and inhumane.
The target this time was the United States — a United
States that in the past helped so many nations defend
their freedoms and their liberty. Now the United States
has been challenged again to defend our freedom by
protecting its own and to safeguard our lives by
securing its own.
The attack on the World Trade Center precipitated
a new division in our epoch and in the years to come —
a divide created by groups that preach and cause death
and agony. On the wrong side of the divide are those
who are trying to destroy the free world, which is
diversified and heterogeneous, cherishing the right to
every thought and religion as well as the principle that
every human being has the right to be different and yet
to prosper and live in security.

The front from Bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is a
menace to us all. It will not enable peace, nor will it
permit freedom — for all people or for their own
people. In countries that harbour terror, women are
discriminated against, men are oppressed, civil and
human rights are violated, and the poor cannot escape
from their poverty They force us to defend our
inalienable right to look ahead with hope. They
imposed on us a war of self-defence — the defence of
pluralism and of the promise of science. They reject the
incredible technologies that may carry us from the
limits of land to the discovery of uncharted provinces.
The culture of death forces us to defend the culture of
life, to win battles that we did not initiate, to triumph in
this uninvited war.
We never imagined that it could be dangerous to
walk our streets, to fly our skies, to breathe the air or to
drink the water. We cannot agree to this. We cannot
allow dark forces — which, as we are aware, could
destroy the lives of innocent people on a whim — to
possess weapons of mass destruction. We shall not turn
our lives into a series of sleepless nights and
nightmarish days.
We do not have the right to ignore the danger. We
do not have the option to postpone it; it is imminent.
We have to win as soon as possible.
Terror is destined to lose. It will be defeated
because it carries no hope. It respects neither human
beings nor the values of humanity.
Science and technology made the economy
global, and science and technology globalized terror as
well. Now strategy also is globalized, because ballistic
ranges have replaced geographic distances, because
non-conventional warheads have replaced measurable
explosives, because terrorism transcends frontiers and
fronts. Terrorists do not respect the rule of law. They
do not answer to independent judges or relate to
elected leaders. They mock international lines. They
destroy universal norms. They shed blood. They
introduced dullness and stopped affluence. Nothing is
to be expected from them but death.
Terror creates poverty more than poverty creates
terror. Terror leads to backwardness. We have to offer
the economic potential to open prospects and horizons
for all nations, poor and rich. New opportunities can
bring enfranchisement. We have to close ranks to
prevent distorted dreams from becoming a raging
typhoon that reaches all four corners of the globe. We
have experienced in our own country the terrible
effects of terrorism.
Babies were shot in the arms of their mothers.
People at prayer were killed while praying. Yes, it hurt
us, but it did not change our goals. We mourn, but we
did not bury peace.
It harmed the Palestinians in the United States
and in other countries. It prevented the occupation
from ending. It introduced additional problems and did
not solve a single existing problem.
Alas, the Middle East is still replete with
national, religious and territorial disputes. The land is
small; the agony is great. But the real tragedy is that
without terror we could already have resolved these
disputes. Terror entrenched them. Terror changed
priorities — security before policy. It affected
resources — arming young men, for example, instead
of desalinating vital water. If it continues, battlefields
will create deserts of sorrow and days of darkness.
Campuses of learning will be replaced by camps of
violence.
But this is neither a decree of heaven nor the
verdict of man. It can, it should, it will be different.
South Africa, Ireland, Yugoslavia and the Congo
achieved more by talking than by shooting, more by
dialogue than by dispute. We offered the Palestinians a
comprehensive solution without the terror — a solution
that was close to their national aspirations. We related
to their desire to be free, to be equal, to be
independent. We agreed that they would have their land
in accordance with United Nations resolutions. But
terror postponed their destiny. Terror postponed our
willingness to end control over their lives. Smoking
guns replaced the torches of peace.
Now we are following the profound debate taking
place among the Palestinians. We respect it, because
debate is the beginning of democracy. When
democracy prevails, peace undoubtedly will arrive. The
Fatah organization apparently issued a call that
contains some new approaches. I shall quote one of
them:
“We will build an independent State of
Palestine and a political system in accordance
with the principles of democracy, the rule of law,
with an independent judicial system, separation
of power, respect for human rights, civil liberties
and a market economy.”


We look upon these words as the dawn of a
different season; we hope that it is spring. Reducing
violence will shorten political distances. Political
horizons are, in my judgement, within reach. Israel
accepts President Bush's vision. That vision is
supported by the Quartet; it is endorsed by Arab
countries; it outlines a political goal and a timetable. It
can be considered as both a road map and a calendar.
What is needed now are wheels to propel the vehicles
of peace. An economic wheel is needed in order for us
to move to a global market economy that leads to
science-based industry. A market economy can open
gates and skies. An ecological wheel is needed to let
air and water flow cleanly. Pollution is not national; we
have to work together to control it. Ecology has
changed history. In the past, bloodshed was about real
estate, and real estate created divisions, demarcation
and, unfortunately, wars as well. In our era, the battle is
not for real estate but for air, for water and for energy;
it is about the fertility of the land, rather than its size.
“Non-real” estate is not marked, nor can it be divided.
Either we respect it unanimously, or we will be
victimized by its loss.
Then there is the cultural wheel. Three
civilizations were born in the Middle East. They were
made manifest in the Bible, in the New Testament and
in the Koran. We read them in different languages, yet
we pray to the same heavens. The descendants of
Abraham should behave like a family — with tolerance
and solidarity. Spiritual leaders should pray for peace,
but they also need to preach it, call upon it and
contribute to it.
The political wheel should not rotate in the same
misguided orbit as in the past. We have been through
five wars in five decades — Palestinians, Egyptians
and Jordanians lost generations of young people. We
paid heavily with young blood as a result of three terror
campaigns. The time has come to comprehend that the
real triumph is in the harvest of peace, not in the seeds
of another war. When we replace the war maps with
peace maps, we will discover that the differences were
minimal. The wars were appalling. We shall see that
the promised land could have become the land of
promise a long time ago.
Without wars, our region will be able to bloom
again. We can separate politically into two States and
coordinate one economy. That will enable us to take
advantage of the exceptional invitation that came from
both the United States and a united Europe to partake
in their economic opportunities.
Tourism can flourish when terrorism has ended.
Islands of high-tech excellence can be established.
Millions of trees can be planted to produce a new
climate. We can make green our arid lands. We can
become contributors, not dependants.
The call of the future cannot be harmonized with
the voices of the past. Only new solutions can evoke a
grandeur equal to the past. We do not have the right to
suspend it in the face of our children. Young Israelis
and young Palestinians are entitled to a new life — a
life of their own. While fighting terror, let us not fight
people. While seeking freedom, let us not extend
subjugation.
I should like to direct a comment to Syria. The
same principle that enabled us both to participate in the
Madrid conference a decade ago is still valid.
A word to Lebanon: Israel is committed to the
territorial integrity of Lebanon. Israel respects its need
for real political independence. Lebanon should not
permit Hezbollah to destroy its own country. Hezbollah
is not a party, it is a dangerous agenda. Lebanon should
immediately free Israeli prisoners and prisoners of war.
The people of the Middle East should let bygones
be bygones. Let us return to our traditions, where
prophets, not terrorists, told the future. Let us return to
our landscape, where the blue skies did not surrender to
the heavy clouds of despair; to a time when justice
promised equal opportunities for individuals and for
nations. Let us join, together, the march of mankind
towards new discoveries that will make life more
purposeful and may bring security to posterity.
We were born in the cradles of hope, not in the
tombs of despair. We guard our spiritual heritage, and
it is not antithetical to building a new Middle East. The
world is new.
I should like to conclude with an old verse from
our scriptures:
“The Lord led Adam through the Garden of
Eden and said to him, ‘All I created, I created for
you. Beware lest you spoil and destroy my world,
for if you spoil it, there is no one to repair it after
you'.”
We are here to repair.










"
3,2007,"ISR_post_1998","Three thousand years ago, the 
people of Israel journeyed from slavery in Egypt to 
independence in the land of Israel. The Bible tells us 
that on their voyage to liberty they made a crucial stop 
and received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai. 
 As the General Assembly gathers this year, the 
Jewish people recall that historic journey by marking 
the festival of Sukkot. And every year, at this time, our 
people remember that the long march to freedom 
requires the acceptance of humanity’s basic values. 
 For 60 years, since the rebirth of our State in our 
ancient homeland, with Jerusalem at its heart, we have 
not lost sight of this principle. The core values of 
tolerance, coexistence and peace that lie at the heart of 
every democracy must be protected within societies 
and promoted between them. This is the calling of our 
generation. 
 The conflict in our region is driven by those who 
reject these core values   those who seek power 
without responsibility, those whose aim is not to 
realize their own rights but to deny those rights for 
others. At its heart, this is a conflict not about territory, 
but about values. 
 There is, of course, a territorial dimension to our 
dispute. We know this and, as we have proven in the 
past, we are prepared for the territorial compromise 
that lasting peace entails. But we also know, especially 
after withdrawing from Lebanon and Gaza, that 
territorial withdrawal by itself will not bring peace 
unless we address the core clash of values that lies 
beneath the conflict. 
 Israel may be on the front lines of this battle, but 
it is not our fight alone. This is a global battle. The 
notion that this battle is a local one, limited to isolated 
regions, collapsed in this city with the twin towers on a 
September morning six years ago. Today, it is clear that 
the extremists are engaged in a bloody war against 
civilians and communities, against hearts and minds, in 
every corner of the world. 
 And it is clear, too, that the Middle East conflict 
is not the cause of this global extremist agenda, but a 
consequence of it. Yes, it is up to the parties in the 
Middle East to settle their political conflict, and Israel, 
for its part, desires to do so. But for success to be 
genuine and lasting, you, the nations of the world, need 
to be partners in a shared global struggle against the 
extremism and terror that feed conflict, for your sake, 
not just for ours. 
 It is in this spirit that I would like to speak today 
about resolving our particular conflict, but also about  
the wider battle being waged today   the battle that 
affects us all. This battle is global, not just because it 
targets civilians everywhere, but also because the 
extremists have taken aim at the fundamental pillars of 
every modern society   namely, democracy, tolerance 
and education. These are the new battlefields of the 
twenty-first century, and it is in these arenas, more than 
any other, that the future of our world will be decided. 
 I believe in democracy. I believe in its 
extraordinary power to produce free and peaceful 
societies founded on respect for human rights. 
Democracy is a profound ideal, but it is also a 
vulnerable one. 
 Today, in different parts of the world, extremists, 
who are opposed to the very ideals of democracy, are 
entering the democratic process, not to abandon their 
violent agenda but to advance it. As a spokesman for 
Al-Qaida recently declared, “We will use your 
democracy to destroy your democracy”. This should be 
a wake-up call for all of us. 
 It is time to reclaim democracy, and this begins 
by rejecting those who abuse it. Genuine democracy is 
about values before it is about voting. No true 
democracy on Earth allows armed militia or groups 
with racist or violent agendas to participate in 
elections. But some demonstrate a troubling double 
standard. There are some who insist on high standards 
in their own country but forget them when they look 
abroad. Violent extremists who could never run for 
office at home are treated as legitimate politicians 
when elected elsewhere. As a result, we empower those 
who use democratic means to advance anti-democratic 
ends. And we strengthen the forces of those who not 
only undermine their societies but also threaten our 
own. 
 Today, from this podium, I call on the 
international community to adopt at the global level 
what democracies apply at the national one: a universal 
set of standards for participation in genuine democratic 
elections. We need a universal democratic code that 
requires that all those seeking the legitimacy of the 
democratic process earn it by respecting such 
principles as State monopoly over the lawful use of 
force, the rejection of racism and violence and the 
protection of the rights of others. 
 The goal of such a universal code is not to dictate 
our values or to stifle legitimate voices with which we 
may disagree. Its goal is to protect core democratic 
values from those determined to use the democratic 
system against itself; and to make clear that 
participation in the democratic process is not just a 
right   it is also a responsibility. 
 I know that the temptation to engage with 
extremists can be strong. It may seem to promise 
stability and quiet. We may hope that by feeding the 
beast we can gradually tame it. As free societies, we 
pride ourselves, rightly, on our respect for difference 
and diversity. But we do a disservice to diversity when, 
in its name, we tolerate the intolerant. 
 Bitter experience has shown that buying off 
extremists is a short-term fix for which we will pay 
dearly in the long run. Instead, groups such as Hamas 
and Hizbullah must be presented with a clear choice 
between the path of violence and the path of 
legitimacy. They cannot have both. And it is this same 
stark choice that must be presented to the radical 
regime in Iran. 
 No responsible State disagrees that Iran is the 
most prominent sponsor of terrorism. It is a major 
source of instability and conflict in Iraq, Lebanon, 
Palestine and across the entire Middle East; and it is 
the enemy of Arab-Israeli coexistence. No one 
disagrees that Iran denies the Holocaust and speaks 
openly of its desire to wipe a Member State   mine   
off the map. And no one disagrees that, in violation of 
Security Council resolutions, it is actively pursuing the 
means to achieve this end. 
 But there are still those who, in the name of 
consensus and engagement, continue to obstruct the 
urgent steps that are needed to bring Iran’s sinister 
ambitions to a halt. Too many see the danger, but they 
walk idly by, hoping that someone else will take care 
of it. What is the value, we have to ask, of an 
organization which is unable to take effective action in 
the face of a direct assault on the very principles it was 
founded to protect? 
 It is time for the United Nations, and the States of 
the world, to live up to their promise of never again, to 
say enough is enough, to act now and to defend their 
basic values. It is also time to see this same kind of 
moral conviction in the Human Rights Council, so that 
it can become a shield for the victims of human rights, 
not a weapon for its abusers. 
 Israel has never tried to avoid genuine discussion 
of its human rights record. But so long as the Council 
maintains its wildly disproportionate focus on Israel, it 
weakens the moral voice of the United Nations, and the 
price of this blindness is paid by the victims of human 
rights atrocities in Darfur and Myanmar and 
throughout the world. 
 There is no more accurate forecast for the future 
of a society than the lessons we teach our children. 
Unfortunately, in our region, we see children’s 
television programmes in which Mickey Mouse 
puppets teach the glory of being a suicide bomber and 
a seven-year old girl sings of her dreams of blood and 
battle. Religion, rather than being a source of hope and 
spiritual healing, is abused as a call to arms, as God is 
dragged once again onto the field of battle. 
 It is time to reclaim religion from those who have 
made it a weapon rather than a shelter. It is time to 
reclaim education from those who use it as a tool of 
hate rather than an opportunity. As always, the most 
powerful form of education, and the hardest, is to teach 
by example. We cannot expect our younger generation 
to value what we are not prepared ourselves to protect 
and pay a price for. And there is a price to pay. From 
the leader who has to withstand public pressures. From 
the businessman who has to forgo economic 
opportunity. From the teacher and spiritual guide who 
must find the inner strength to teach truth and tolerance 
in a climate of extremism and hostility. At all levels of 
society, there is a price to be paid. But if we do not pay 
it today, we, and those who follow us, will face a far 
greater bill tomorrow. 
 These thoughts are in my mind as we seek, today, 
to advance the cause of Israeli-Palestinian 
reconciliation. Reconciliation is not about deciding 
who was right or who was wrong in the past; it is about 
sharing a common vision and a common responsibility 
for the future. In the last months, Prime Minister 
Olmert and President Abbas have been engaged in a 
sincere and genuine effort to reach the widest possible 
common ground on political understandings. There is 
no substitute for the bilateral process. Failure is not an 
option, but it is for the parties themselves to define 
success. The foundation for true peace lies in the vision 
of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side 
in peace and security. The world shares this vision, but 
it is also important that it clearly embrace the two core 
principles that emerge from it. 
 The first of these principles is: two States, two 
homelands. Just as Israel is homeland to the Jewish 
people, so Palestine will be established as the 
homeland and the national answer for the Palestinian 
people, including the refugees. 
 The second is: living side by side in peace and 
security. Just as a viable and prosperous Palestine in 
the West Bank and Gaza is an Israeli interest, so must a 
secure Israel be a Palestinian interest. The world 
cannot afford another terror State. 
 Guided by these principles, the parties can define 
a common border and turn the two-State vision from a 
dream into reality. To succeed, we must set our sights 
on a brighter future, while responding to the challenges 
of the present and learning the lessons of the past. As 
we make progress on concrete political understandings, 
it is just as important to change the reality on the 
ground   to show Palestinians and Israelis that the 
promise of peace exists in practice, not just on paper. 
 In recent months, Israel has taken tangible 
measures to create a better environment, and we are 
ready to do more. We know that Palestinian life is full 
of day-to-day hardship. We know also, and only too 
well, the burden of terror that Israelis bear and of our 
primary obligation to their security. Together, we can 
change this reality; we do not need to submit to it. 
 We are not naive. We can see the difficulties 
ahead and the enemies of peace that stand in our way. 
But practical progress is possible in those areas where 
there is an effective Palestinian Government that 
accepts the Quartet’s principles and implements, 
alongside Israel, the existing Road Map obligations. 
 As the parties take the risks for peace, we look to 
the international community and the Arab and Muslim 
world to offer support, not to stipulate conditions. This 
support comes in many forms. It comes through 
economic and political assistance to the new 
Palestinian Government committed to coexistence and 
seeking to build the foundations of a peaceful and 
prosperous State. It comes through the clear 
endorsement of any political understandings reached 
between the parties. It comes through enhancing and 
deepening regional ties and cooperation between the 
Arab world and Israel, while in parallel we advance 
towards Israeli-Palestinian peace. And, finally, it 
comes by confronting those determined to prevent us 
from succeeding. 
 We must stand up to those who have no respect 
for human life or human liberty, those who hold 
captive soldiers - Gilad Shalit, Udi Goldwasser and 
Eldad Regev - whose families are with us today and 
whose pain remains always in our hearts. 
 We must stand up to those who, after we 
withdrew from Gaza to give peace a chance, chose not 
to build but to destroy and who choose, on a daily 
basis, to target Israeli homes and kindergartens with 
their missiles. 
 And we must stand up to those who see 
democracy as a tool to advance hate, who see tolerance 
as a one-way street and who see education as a means 
of poisoning the minds of the next generation. 
 I believe that, despite all the obstacles, there is a 
new moment of opportunity and an alliance of interest 
that favours peace. Time is of the essence. We owe it to 
ourselves and to our children to find both the courage 
and the wisdom to make the right choices in the right 
way. 
 On this festival of Sukkot, Jews commemorate 
the journey from slavery to freedom by leaving their 
homes to live in fragile huts, like the shelters in which 
our ancestors lived on their way to the Promised Land. 
For 3,000 years, these temporary huts, open to the 
elements, have been a reminder that stability and 
security are ensured not only by the structures that we 
build but also by the values that we share. Perhaps it is 
for this reason that the Sukkah, this fragile shelter, has 
become the Jewish symbol of peace. 
 We turn to Jerusalem and say in our prayers every 
day: Spread over us the canopy of your peace. May it 
be in our days, and for all nations."
3,2008,"ISR_post_1998","Over 60 years have passed 
since the General Assembly voted on the historic 
resolution that would have put an end to the Arab-
Israeli conflict. Resolution 181 (II) called for the 
establishment of a Jewish State and an Arab State. Its 
title was: “Plan of Partition with Economic Union”. It 
envisioned two States for two peoples, fulfilling a 
distinct national aspiration. The Jewish people adopted 
the resolution and established the State of Israel. The 
Arabs rejected it, and this led to war. 
 What happened in the ensuing years is much 
different from the resolution’s original intent. While 
much has changed since then, the ironies of history 
summon similar circumstances today. Today, again, we 
are in the middle of the lake. There is no sense going 
back. Continuing forward will show how near we are 
to achieving the initial goal. 
 A year prior to Israel’s declaration of statehood, 
its first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, called me, 
a young man from a kibbutz, to serve in our national 
defence. Since then, I have participated in Israel’s 
dynamic realities: the building of security; the striving 
for peace. So, I need no books to learn the history, 
since I witnessed its miraculous unfolding. We went 
through seven wars. All have paid heavily. Tears still 
flow down the faces of bereaved mothers. 
Remembrance days fill the air with silent prayers of 
widowed families who lost young boys and girls in 
battle. They are, today, the same age, but lifeless.  
 Israel turned military victories into peace 
processes, knowing that the cost of life renders 
imperfect peace superior to perfect victories. 
 We have also achieved two peace agreements: the 
first, with the largest Arab country, Egypt; the second, 
with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. All the land, 
all the water, all the natural resources that fell into our 
hands through war were completely repatriated after 
peace was signed.  
 But for peace, the call in our region is to repair 
the damaged environment and the wounded land which 
leads to poverty. If we do not overcome the desert, the 
thirst, the pollution, they will overcome us. Joint 
 
 
33 08-51749 
 
ventures can meet this call. Nature does not carry a 
national passport. 
 With the Palestinians, we negotiate full peace. 
Both parties agreed to building a Palestinian State side 
by side with Israel, living in peace, security and 
respect. We tried to conclude those negotiations this 
year. Apparently, this will take a longer time. I believe 
it can be accomplished, in spite of this, within the next 
year. 
 I know that our Prime Minister is more than 
ready to conclude an agreement. And knowing 
President Abbas as well, I am sure he will not miss this 
opportunity. We agreed to progress in spite of possible 
changes that may take place in the leadership. Gaps 
have been narrowed through negotiations, particularly, 
and hopefully, the territorial ones. 
 But peace is not just a matter of territorial 
compromise. Rogue politics rejects peace even when 
and where territorial disputes have been resolved. In 
Lebanon, we implemented the resolutions of the United 
Nations, but Hizbullah paralysed the country and cut 
the road to peace. 
 From Gaza, we withdrew completely and 
dismantled all of our settlements. I know there are a 
great many complaints about the settlements: in Gaza, 
we dismantled 30 settlements by order of the 
Government; Hamas responded with a bloody takeover 
and turned the Strip into a base for rocket fire. 
 These militants offer no positive alternative but 
the agonies of Job. They added kidnapping to 
bombings, bringing strife to innocent families. From 
this rostrum, I call for the immediate release of Gilad 
Shalit, the son of Aviva and Noam, a most peace-loving 
family. This Assembly should place the release of that 
person at the top of its priorities. Holding a hostage in 
Gaza, causes Gaza’s isolation and could cause further 
deterioration. 
 At the centre of this violence and fanaticism 
stands Iran. It presents a danger to the entire world. Its 
quest for religious hegemony and regional dominance 
divides the Middle East and holds back chances for 
peace, including among Arabs, while undermining 
human rights. 
 Iranian support for Hizbullah divides Lebanon. 
Its support for Hamas splits the Palestinians; it 
postpones the establishment of the Palestinian State. 
Yesterday, from this very rostrum, the Iranian leader 
renewed the darkest anti-Semitic libel — the 
“Protocols of the Elders of Zion” — bringing to life 
one of the ugliest plots against the Jewish people. Their 
despicable denial of the Holocaust is a mockery of 
indisputable evidence and a cynical offence against the 
survivors of the Holocaust, contrary to the resolutions 
adopted by this very Assembly. 
 Iran continues to develop enriched uranium and 
long-range missiles. It has introduced a religion of fear, 
opposing the call of the Lord to respect human life: all 
humans; all life. The Iranian people are not our 
enemies. Their fanatical leadership is their problem 
and the world’s woe. Their leader is a danger to his 
own people, to the region and to the world. He is a 
disgrace to the ancient Iranian people and tradition. He 
is a disgrace to the values of Islam and all religions. He 
is a disgrace to this House, the United Nations, and its 
basic principles and values. His appearance here is a 
shame.  
 The Jewish people have known throughout 
history that they must stand firm and face evil. 
Enlightened humanity should make it possible for 
freedom and respect to prevail for all of us.  
 Tehran combines long-range missiles with short-
range minds. It is pregnant with tragedies. The General 
Assembly and the Security Council bear the 
responsibility to prevent agonies before they take 
place.  
 Israel has shown that democracies can defend 
themselves. We are able to defend ourselves. We do not 
intend to change that capacity to defend ourselves.  
 Terrorism has not solved a single problem. It 
never has; it never will. It will make the world 
ungovernable. If groups of killers are allowed to 
threaten innocent masses, the world — if it continues 
to survive — will be without order and security, a 
hopeless battleground. The free world must unite to 
stop this, to combat it. 
 Israel, for its part, shall continue to seek peace 
sincerely and fully. We suggest immediate peace with 
Lebanon. Israeli Prime Ministers have indicated to 
Syria that, for peace, we are ready to explore a 
comprehensive compromise. To gain trust and save 
time, we have suggested a face-to-face meeting with 
President Assad. I say to the President: “Follow the 
successful example set by President Sadat and King 
Hussein”. We await an answer. 
  
 
08-51749 34 
 
 I know there is a growing concern that peace is 
far away. My lifelong experience provides me with a 
different judgement. True, I have seen stagnation, 
regression and failure in our journey, but today I can 
identify a road leading in the right direction. In 
addition to the peace agreements, a series of summits 
have taken place: Madrid, Oslo, Wye, Camp David, 
Sharm el-Sheik, Annapolis. In fact, Israelis and Arabs 
are marching towards peace. After a long internal 
debate, Israel has chosen to support the two-State 
solution. 
 Furthermore, I must say that in Beirut, the Arab 
League replaced the three “nays” of Khartoum — 
which were no peace, no negotiation, no recognition — 
with an initiative inaugurated by King Abdullah Bin 
Abdulaziz Al Saud. I call upon the King to further his 
initiative. It may become an invitation for 
comprehensive peace — one to transform a 
battleground into a common ground. 
 I respectfully invite all leaders to come to discuss 
peace in Jerusalem — which is holy to all of us — 
where all of us are praying to the same Lord as 
offspring of the same Father. Israel shall gladly accept 
an Arab invitation to designate a venue where a 
meaningful dialogue may take place at their choice. 
 We are facing a serious economic crisis in the 
world. Perhaps it has happened because we are rich and 
light with funds and poor and heavy with ideas, while 
we live in an era in which science, not land, is the basis 
for a successful economy. Science does not stop at 
borders; it is not disturbed by distances. Wisdom 
cannot be conquered by armies. Knowledge diminishes 
discrimination because it operates through goodwill 
and transcends race, nationality, colour and gender. 
 The global dangers unite and divide us at the 
same time. The dangers are clear: degradation of the 
environment, shortage of water, lack of renewable 
energy, the spread of terrorism and, alas, increased 
poverty among millions and millions of people. The 
divisions of the free world may increase them. Unity 
may offer alternatives. It would direct global 
investments to new areas and to demanding challenges 
such as health, security, education and the 
environment. 
 The future is not in the hands of oil or gold. 
Intellectual assets, new inventions and superior 
education hold the key to the future of each of us. In 
our region, border areas could become open economic 
zones, permitting the free movement of people, 
commodities and ideas. They could encourage tourism 
and build high-tech incubators. They could cultivate 
and advance modern agriculture. Economic zones 
would provide a million jobs and produce billions of 
cubic metres of desalinated water for the Arabs, for the 
Palestinians, for the Jordanians, for Israel — for all of 
us. We have already started to do this; the initial steps 
are promising. 
 The Jewish people are celebrating a New Year. I 
would like to end with a quote by Rabbi Nachman of 
Breslav: 
 “May it be thy will to remove war and bloodshed 
from the world and perpetuate the wonders and 
greatness of peace. All the inhabitants of the 
world shall recognize and know the truth: that we 
have not been placed on this earth to wage war 
and not for hatred or bloodshed.” 
I will repeat it in Hebrew. 
 (The speaker repeated the quote in Hebrew)"
3,2003,"ISR_post_1998","I would like to congratulate
His Excellency, the Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia,
upon his assumption of the Presidency of the General
Assembly, and wish him much success.
Until just one month ago, every person in this hall
and every Member of this Organization joined us in the
hope that the Middle East peace process might finally
be back on track, and that a resolution of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict might be on the horizon. The
establishment of a new Palestinian Government
promised an end to terror and a new beginning.
This glimmer of hope was darkened on 19 August
by the extremists who blew up a bus full of Jewish
families on their way home from prayers at the Western
Wall, the holiest site in the Jewish religion. Twenty-
three people, young and old, mothers and babies in
their cradles, were slaughtered in that attack. That
attack was carried out by Hamas, a terrorist
organization, which, under the road map, should have
been dismantled by the Palestinian Authority. Failure
to dismantle Hamas and other extremist organizations
has brought our diplomatic efforts to a standstill.
Rather than acting to fulfil its obligation, the
Palestinian Authority has chosen the route of inaction,
and complicity in terror.
We cannot allow this to continue. We must restore
hope that we can build a better future for our children.
The infrastructure of terror must be dismantled so that
we can put our peace efforts back on track. There is no
time other than now. There is no other way.
For many years it was thought that terrorism in
the Middle East was Israel’s problem, not the world’s.
Today, the world knows otherwise. Today, it is not only
Israel that mourns the loss of its loved ones, including
women and children and babies, at the hands of the
terrorists. Sadly, we have been joined by peoples from
across the globe — from Mombassa to Casablanca and
from Moscow to Bali. Even the United Nations, which
for so many has been a symbol of peace and goodwill,
is not immune.
28
 
Gathered here today in New York, just two short
years after 11 September, the community of nations
knows that those who seek to advance their political
agendas through killing innocents are ready to strike at
anyone or anything that represents the values of
freedom and human life.
Terrorism has declared war on us all. Israel has
often stood alone in this battle. A country that has
suffered more than any other from terrorism, we have
always understood the danger it poses to democracy
and freedom everywhere, even when others refused to
see this, and condemned us for our actions. We have
always understood that terrorism, no matter what cause it
claims to serve, seeks only to destroy, rather than to build.
There can be no neutrality in the war against
terrorism and there can be no immunity for those who
engage in it. Abstaining is not an option. This is not a
war of choice. Terrorism will not be eliminated until
the world unites against it. Our only choice is to win.
Every member of the international community must
take concrete and proactive measures to cut off all
channels of financial, moral and political support to
this common enemy.
States Members of this institution that sponsor
terrorists and give them shelter are accomplices in the
acts of terror themselves. They must be held
accountable for their crimes. It is no coincidence that
States that sponsor terrorism, like Iran and Syria, are
also striving to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
Their hostility to freedom and the rule of law puts the
very future of humanity in jeopardy.
I know that many in this place see Yasser Arafat
as the symbol of the Palestinian struggle. Tragically,
for his people and for ours, he is one of the world’s
icons of terror. In the 10 years since Arafat made a
commitment to Israel and the world that he would no
longer use terror, 1,126 Israelis have been killed and
thousands wounded in 19,000 separate Palestinian
terrorist attacks. In relative numbers, this would be the
same as 11,000 French or 56,000 Americans dying
from terrorism in the same period of time.
This carnage must stop. Its impact on both
societies is devastating. Yasser Arafat bears direct
responsibility for this terrible suffering. He has led his
people along the path of terror — from hijackings to
suicide bombings — for more than 30 years, always
preferring Israeli pain over Palestinian gain. He has
been — and he remains — the greatest obstacle to
peace between our peoples. For as long as he controls
the levers of power, no moderate leadership can
emerge. To vote for Arafat, like we saw in this
Assembly just last week, is to vote against the
Palestinian people. When Arafat wins, terrorism wins,
and we all lose. Instead of rallying around Arafat, the
international community must rally around the genuine
interests of the Palestinian people. They must do so
now, before he leads them even further down the path
of terror and destruction.
When a responsible and empowered Palestinian
leadership finally emerges — a leadership ready to join
the war on terror — it will find us a willing partner for
peace. Israel is committed to the vision for Middle East
peace laid out by United States President George Bush
on 24 June 2002. Israel will not compromise on the
safety of its citizens, but we will go the extra mile, as
we have proven before, to bring peace and security to
both our peoples.
We are ready to work with the Palestinians and
with the international community to make this vision a
reality. For this to happen, the Palestinian leadership
must take the moral and strategic decision to abandon
terrorism once and for all, and make peacemaking
possible. They must guide their people to build their
own society, rather than seek to destroy ours. They,
too, must understand that it is not poverty that breeds
terror but terror that breeds poverty.
We cannot stop only at dismantling the
infrastructure of terror. We must also build an
infrastructure of peace. It is up to political and moral
leaders everywhere to foster an environment which
rejects extremism and empowers the peacemakers. This
is particularly so in the Arab and Muslim world, where
incitement against Israel closes hearts and minds to the
possibility of peace.
Leaders must guide their people away from the
culture of hate, and replace it with a culture of
tolerance. Concrete expressions of cooperation and
exchange must be built in media and government,
education, science and business, to reinforce the
message of tolerance and acceptance.
For the sake of our collective future, voices of
moderation must be heard. For the sake of our
collective future, Israel and the Arab nations must learn
to live together side by side, to overcome our conflicts
just as the nations of Europe have learned to overcome
theirs. Israel is living among its Arab neighbours. We
29
 
believe in a common future of peace and prosperity
with them. My many meetings with Arab leaders over
the last few days have encouraged me to believe that
together we can make our region a better place.
This culture of peace must permeate not only the
borders of the Middle East, it must permeate the walls
of the United Nations as well. In the past, the United
Nations has shown us that it can play a positive role.
This Assembly was key to the founding of the State of
Israel, 55 years ago. Security Council resolutions 242
(1967) and 338 (1973) are our guideposts to
negotiations and peace.
To play such a constructive role in the future, the
United Nations must reform. It must move away from
the partisan hostility that has taken over its Middle East
agenda. For more than three decades, this Assembly
has passed every year a litany of resolutions designed
to discredit Israel, challenge its interests, and promote
the will of its greatest enemies.
In my hand I am holding a collection of the
decisions of the fifty-seventh General Assembly on the
Middle East — 175 pages filled not with hope, but with
the negative agendas of the past. No other country has
suffered such unjustified attack and consistent
discrimination within the United Nations system. The
time has come to end this campaign of diplomatic
incitement. For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians —
for the sake of the United Nations and peace itself — I
call on this body to rise above the tired politics of
yesterday, and adopt a new, courageous agenda for
tomorrow.
I call on the General Assembly to abandon the
automatic adoption of anti-Israel resolutions and to
find ways of making itself relevant once again to the
interests of the people it claims to serve. I call on this
Assembly to fulfil its historic mission and help
promote what unites us, not what divides us.
On the morning of 1 February of this year, Israel
lost its first astronaut in the Space Shuttle Columbia
disaster — a skilled and courageous pilot whom I knew
personally, a child of Holocaust survivors, a national
hero. Colonel Ilan Ramon embodied the spirit of our
nation. He was a man of courage and action, dedicated
to the well-being of his people. Just as he sought to
contribute to the advancement of his fellow man, he
met his death, together with colleagues from the United
States and India, on a scientific mission in the name of
humanity as a whole.
Israel’s place in such endeavours of international
cooperation and accomplishment is no coincidence. In
the 55 years since the State of Israel was established,
recognized and welcomed into the family of nations,
our achievements in the fields of science and
technology, the arts and literature and agriculture and
medicine have come to rank with the best in the world.
Our international cooperation programme is celebrated
in over a hundred countries around the globe, sharing
skills, experience and knowledge for the benefit of
millions of people. We extend this hand of friendship
to all the nations of the world. We welcome our
improving relations with Europe, just as we remain
committed to promoting closer ties with the nations of
Africa, Asia and the Americas.
The Zionist vision of Israel’s founders was to
bring into the world a State in our ancient homeland to
serve as a haven from persecution for our people, a
place where the Jewish people could fulfil its right to
self-determination in the modern era and a bastion of
democracy and opportunity for all its citizens. Our
founders also made a promise not just to the people of
Israel, but also to the people of the Middle East as a
whole — to pursue peace and to work for the common
advancement of our region.
I know personally the profound meaning of this
historic undertaking. I came to Israel as a young
refugee from Tunisia. I serve as one of hundreds of
thousands of immigrants to whom Israel has granted
promise and protection, freedom and opportunity,
through the values and institutions of democracy.
I stand here today to reaffirm, before the nations
of the world, the commitment of my country to peace.
Peace for the people of Israel is both a moral and
historic imperative. “Shalom” — the word for peace in
Hebrew — is central to our language and our heritage.
It is how we say “hello” and it is how we say
“goodbye”. It is a name we give to our children. It is
my own family name.
It was our prophet Isaiah, who brought this
message of peace to the world centuries ago, when he
said: “And they shall beat their swords into
ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.
Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation, neither
shall they learn war any more”.
Israel’s historic record is clear. Whenever a true
partner for peace has emerged, he has been met with
Israel’s extended hand. This was true when President
30
 
Anwar Sadat of Egypt came to Jerusalem in 1977 and it
was true when King Hussein of Jordan signed the
Peace Treaty with us in 1994. The same is true today.
Israel stands ready to complete the circle of peace with
all its neighbours — real peace, not just peace for the
headlines, but peace which brings an end to violence
and hostility and positive change for the citizens of our
region.
From this great rostrum — a rostrum shared by
all humanity — I call on the leaders of Syria and
Lebanon, of Iran and of the Palestinian people to
abandon once and for all their hostility towards us and
to join us in building a better future for our children.
This evening, I shall return to Jerusalem, the
eternal capital of the Jewish people, to join with them
in celebrating Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
According to our tradition, this is a time when God
determines the fate of each and every individual for the
coming year. These are days of reflection and prayer.
May all our prayers for peace and for life be answered,
and may the actions and deeds of all the States and
peoples represented here in this Hall bring to mankind
peace and all the blessings that life can offer.



"
3,2004,"ISR_post_1998","I would like to congratulate
you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of Gabon, upon your
assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly
and to wish you much success.
The United Nations was established out of the
devastation of the Second World War in order to build
a world of unity and of peace. Today, 60 years after the
Organization came into being, we must ask ourselves:
What are we united for and what are we united against?
Are we united for peace and security? Are we united
for fairness and justice? Are we united against terror?
Are we united against tyranny?
Or are we, sadly, united only in cynical and
immoral majority votes that make a mockery of the
noble ideals on which this body was founded?
Tomorrow is Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish
calendar, when all Jews stand before God to account
for their actions. It is an appropriate time for all
19

nations, separately and together, to engage in such an
accounting.
I sense a change in the world. In the face of the
global campaign of terror which has left no country
free of its devastating impact, the world is beginning to
realize what we in Israel have long known: that
terrorism is a challenge to humanity as a whole, not
just to individual countries; that the response to that
global threat must also be global if it is to be effective;
that the threat of terrorism anywhere is a threat to
freedom everywhere; that fighting terror is crucial to
our ability to bring peace.
There was a time when the problems of terror,
Islamic fundamentalism and Iranian nuclear ambition
were seen as local problems — Israel’s problems —
not challenges which threatened the community of
nations as a whole. Today, however, our community of
nations is more united than ever in the battle against
terrorism, whose sole objective is to undermine
everything that we seek to build: peace, stability,
prosperity and opportunity for all.
Today we are also more united than ever in
opposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. The international community now realizes
that Iran — with missiles that can reach London, Paris,
Berlin and southern Russia — poses a threat not only
to the security of Israel, but to the security and stability
of the whole world. Indeed, Iran has replaced Saddam
Hussein as the world’s number-one exporter of terror,
hate and instability.
The international community now also realizes,
as reflected in Security Council resolution 1559
(2004), that Syria’s occupation of Lebanon and its
support for Palestinian terror must end if our collective
aspirations are to be fulfilled.
And the international community now realizes
that terror and tyranny are the twin enemies of the
individual freedoms and human rights — including the
right to life itself — which define our humanity.
Today, the community of nations knows that
securing freedom and democracy for all the peoples of the
world must be our collective goal. The pictures of human
flesh torn apart by the terrorists, from New York to
Beslan — and just yesterday, once again, in Jerusalem
— are waking us up to the challenge we face.
In that spirit of unity, and in the name of all those
in the world who suffer from terror and tyranny, I call
on the Assembly to refocus its aspirations and its
priorities. I call on the Assembly to end its obsession
with Israel and to ensure that United Nations resources
are allocated more equally and more effectively. Our
United Nations must provide solutions to the global
challenges of hunger and poverty, of disease and
weapons proliferation, of drug trafficking and
sustainable development. We must not let the
Palestinian desire to vilify Israel distract our global
community from the obligation to address the needs of
all peoples.
I call on the Assembly to address head-on the
active involvement of Iran and Syria in terrorism and
Syria’s continued occupation of Lebanon. There can be
no place in the community of nations for those who
promote the killing of children. I call on the Assembly
to promote practical measures to help nations cut off
all financial and political lifelines of terror.
I call on the Assembly to address the growth of
anti-Semitism and other forms of racism and
intolerance. I urge you, Mr. President, and the
Secretary-General, to convene a special session of the
Assembly on that crucial matter. We all share the
responsibility to educate our children to understanding
and tolerance rather than to hatred and incitement.
We must build a united and global coalition to
fight terrorism, racism and anti-Semitism. We must
build a united front against the cold-blooded murderers
of our children. In that battle, there is no middle
ground. There is no room for explanations or excuses.
There are no mitigating circumstances. Declarations
and condemnations are very important, but they are not
enough. Every nation, every Government, every leader
has the responsibility to act. Those who choose instead
to support and sponsor terror must be isolated and held
to account for their crimes.
When I speak of terror and its dangers to life and
freedom, I speak from bitter personal experience. My
own home town of Beersheva suffered a double suicide
bombing just three weeks ago. Sixteen innocent people
were killed when their commuter buses were blown up.
In the middle of an important meeting with visiting
officials, I rushed to call my mother and brother to
check that they were alive. Hamas, which operates
freely from Palestinian territory and receives support
and safe haven from the regimes in Damascus and
Tehran, proudly claimed responsibility for that horrific
attack.
20

Again yesterday, as I was meeting with the
Secretary-General to discuss peace in the Middle East,
I was passed a note informing me of a suicide atrocity,
in which two more Israelis were blown to pieces by a
Palestinian terrorist. And this morning, once again, yet
more Palestinian murderers took the lives of three
young Israelis in an attack on Morag.
In the last year alone, 150 Israelis have been
killed and thousands more injured in more than 40
separate suicide bombings and other cold-blooded
attacks. More than 200 additional suicide-bombing
attempts were blocked by our defensive measures.
No Israeli mother is free of the fear that her child
may be lost. No Israeli child is immune to the
terrorists’ plans. In the name of God above and all
humanity here on Earth, this killing must stop.
Palestinian terrorism is the key reason that the
dream of peace in the Middle East has not yet become
a reality. Combating this terror is crucial to the
prospects for peace in our region. No peace initiative
can survive if terrorists continue to enjoy a free hand to
undermine it.
The road map recognizes this, calling, in phase
one, for sustained Palestinian action against terror, the
dismantling of terrorist organizations and the end of
incitement in schools and the media. Sadly, the current
Palestinian leadership has refused to fulfil those
fundamental obligations, preferring to blame Israel for
all its failures. The Palestinian side spends more energy
fighting Israel here at the United Nations than it does
fighting the terrorists in its own territory.
In the post-11-September world, this is not
acceptable. The Palestinians are not exempt from the
imperatives of the global war on terror. On the
contrary, it is in their clear interest to join it. To stand
up against Hamas and Islamic Jihad is to stand up for
Palestinian rights, not against them.
We urge the international community to recognize
this reality and help the voices of reform and
moderation within Palestinian society to emerge. The
future of the Palestinian people will be determined by
the choices that the Palestinians and their leadership
make on the ground. The solutions — for the
Palestinians and Israelis as one — lie in Gaza and
Ramallah, not in The Hague or New York.
Israel is acting in both the diplomatic and the
security arenas to deal with the consequences of this
chronic failure of the Palestinian leadership. On the
diplomatic front, Israel accepted the road map in May
2003, and we remain committed to its realization. At
this time, however, we have no responsible Palestinian
partner ready to join us in this effort. Israel is now
planning to implement the disengagement plan as a
means of enhancing security and establishing a new,
more promising platform for a return to negotiations.
We are in constant contact with the donor community
and the World Bank in a joint effort to rebuild Gaza in
the wake of Israel’s withdrawal.
On the security front, Israel is building a security
fence to stop the unchecked wave of Palestinian
attacks. After 20,000 terrorist attacks, we deserve to
protect our people. No other country would act
otherwise after 20, let alone 20,000, terrorist attacks.
The fence does not take lives. It saves them. Where
there is a fence, there is no terror. Where there is no
fence, there is terror. The modified route of the fence
reflects the necessary balance between the security of
our citizens and the welfare of the Palestinian
population, as called for by Israel’s Supreme Court.
Most important, the fence is reversible. The lives taken
by terror are irreversible. By helping take terrorism out
of the equation, the fence contributes to the prospect of
a return to negotiations and the realization of the road
map’s vision of peace.
I call on the Assembly to acknowledge this truth
and to reject the continued Palestinian effort to have
delegations address Israel’s response to terrorism,
instead of addressing the terrorism itself.
Ultimately, we need real contact and dialogue,
based on mutual respect for the humanity of the other
if we are to resolve the conflict in the Middle East. The
Government of Israel is ready for such contact. We are
ready to talk to any leadership — from Syria, Lebanon
or the Palestinians — that comes to the table without
terror and with the genuine intention of finding
mutually acceptable solutions to our differences.
Tomorrow, Yom Kippur, is a day of prayer,
fasting and soul-searching for the Jews. In Beersheva,
in a synagogue named after my father, I will be praying
together with those who have recently buried their
murdered children. I will pray that our collective
aspiration for life and freedom will prevail over the
terrorists and those who sponsor them. I will pray that
God will deliver peace on earth, for all humanity. And
I will pray that mankind can unite — through the
21

United Nations — to help make this dream become a
reality.
And I would like to say in Hebrew, Happy New
Year."
4,1972,"ISR_prev_1998","Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for this session, and 1 wish Secretary-General Waldheim well as he embarks on his heavy responsibilities.
65.	There is much violence in the international air, and the atmosphere of it can be felt in this very hall. But we should not forget that the past year has been fruitful for international conciliation. The main theme has been the victory of dialog. Complexes and taboos which had prevented contact between adversaries have almost everywhere been overcome. We read of meetings and agreements between the United States and the People's Republic of China; between West and East Germany; between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland; between North and South Korea; between the United States and the Soviet Union; between the United States and North Viet-Nam; between the rivals of yesterday who are the partners of today in the European community; and even between India and Pakistan on the very morrow of their armed clash.
66.	How improbable all this would have seemed a short time ago! There is a new spirit in international relations. The polemical and rhetorical mood which dominated the past two decades has given way to a strong instinct for conciliation. Hie question that preoccupies nations today is not how they fell into conflict in the past, but how they can live side by side, together, in the future.
67.	If we look more deeply into the successes of diplomacy in the past year, we find a strong similarity in the conditions under which they were achieved. These successes have all been secured by direct settlement. They have all been the result of laborious and reticent preparation. They have all been the product of agreement, not of external adjudication. In every single case the pursuit of agreement has had to take place outside the United Nations frame-work.
68.	This is of course a significant reflection on the institutional condition of this Organization. It justifies a long hard look at its techniques, its procedures and its atmosphere, which have clearly not been congenial to the craftsmanship of peace. The plain fact is that strident public debate is not a good method of peacemaking but a poor substitute for it. An annual exercise in polemics with preordained voting results either paralyzes conciliation or delays its commencement.
69.	I said here last year [1946th meeting] that the Middle East was the only area in which the parties to a conflict were not engaged in a dialog to bring it to an end. That is still the situation. Those who will have to live together side by side in our region have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. This is a primary source of deadlock. In all other international disputes the breakthrough has come on the level of communication, and not through substantive commitments ahead of negotiation. The very decision of governments to make contact with each other creates a dynamic of its own. It transforms the context of their relationships and leads to mutual adjustment of their positions and thereafter towards binding agreements.
70.	Despite this central disappointment, the Middle Eastern scene has not become darker in the past year. The cease-fire has been maintained. There seems to be less feasibility for full-scale hostilities. Despite deplorable slogans about ""inevitable struggle"", it is clear that resumed fighting would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The retirement of Soviet forces and equipment from Egypt has stripped the conflict of its dangerous global dimension. Powers outside the Middle East cannot solve our region's problems; they have not fought its wars and they will not build its peace. The idea of a settlement imposed from outside has become visibly weaker. It is explicitly rejected by some of the Powers; and the summit meeting between the leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union in May 1972 revealed what an illusory prospect it is. Once it becomes generally understood that a military solution is not feasible and that an imposed solution is excluded by the international realities of our times, a negotiated peace will emerge as the only valid alternative. The central aim of our policy is to create this consciousness: we aspire to break out of deadlock into a new vision and a new hope.
71.	The developments in Egypt during July 1972 made it natural for the Israeli Government to restate its positions on a negotiated peace. Our ambition is to see an end of belligerency and conflict and to advance towards a peaceful future. Negotiation is not an act of ""humiliation"" or ""surrender"" for anybody, as some Arab leaders have said. It is a supreme assertion of national sovereignty and of international responsibility. Courage in leadership does not belong to the battlefield alone; it can be put to the service of conciliation and peace.
72.	In maintaining the cease-fire positions until peace is obtained, we do not seek to perpetuate the cease-fire lines or to freeze the existing situation for ever. Our proposals for permanent boundaries to be established for the first time between Israel and its Arab neighbors will be determined by the need to ensure security and to prevent new wars such as that which arose from the fragile and vulnerable armistice lines of 1967. The construction of a stable peace and security between Israel and Egypt requires a precise, detailed negotiation on territorial delimitation.
73.	The deadlock on the over-all settlement in this sector arises from the fact that Egypt has so far refused to begin negotiation unless its position on the final outcome is conceded in advance. There is no valid precedent for such an approach. Negotiation creates the final result; the final result does not create negotiation. We seek no binding commitments from Egypt in advance on matters that are subject to negotiation. We have not sought to determine the final peace boundary, and we have drawn no alternative maps.
74.	It is unlikely that a transition from complete deadlock to complete peace can be made in one stage. Accordingly, the Israeli Government through its Prime Minister reiterated on 27 July this year its readiness to negotiate a special Suez Canal agreement. Such an accord would be a contribution and a stimulus to an over-all peace. We would consider such an arrangement as a temporary solution and as a step towards peace. In the atmosphere of confidence created by such an agreement, a momentum for further accords would be generated.
75.	It is far-fetched to assert that the positions which I have briefly outlined today offer Arab Governments no possibility of honorable and meaningful negotiation. These principles correspond to the norms of international conciliation. What is required is the application to the
Middle East of the spirit and method that have had successful results elsewhere.
76.	The lack of Egyptian response so far to Israel's willingness to negotiate a temporary Suez agreement has long been an obstacle to progress. So, too, is the deadlock created by Cairo's insistence on determining the boundary and withdrawal issues before and without negotiation. In addition, a new massive barrier to peace has arisen through the resurgence of the Arab terrorist outrages which have sent a shock of revulsion through the civilized world.
77.	The story seems unending. Only a few hours ago, the heroes of the Arab liberation movement handed a transistor radio to a woman passenger about to embark on an airliner from Paris to Israel, with hundreds of passengers. It contained a heavy explosive charge. The passenger showed the vigilance necessary to transmit it to the security authorities. The moral qualities of this terrorism come to expression here.
78.	When the Secretary-General decided to request the inclusion in the agenda of an item on international terrorism [A/8791 and Add.l], he was giving a correct and perceptive interpretation of his rights and duties under the Charter. Organized groups of terrorists, for whom violence is both a means and an end, are threatening the texture of international life. Innocent civilians live in fear of attack by murder squads from abroad. The airlines work in an atmosphere of vulnerability. The international mails are violated by the assaults of cowardly men whose malice knows no compassion and no restraint.
79.	There are many forms and varieties of terrorist violence. They spread like a contagious germ. They respond to destructive and nihilist impulses that have taken root in contemporary culture. And the ultimate arrogance of the terrorists is not that they perform their outrages, but that they then ask for understanding and endorsement. They base their assault on the proposition that all restraints, civilities, immunities and human solidarities must be sacrificed to what they unilaterally proclaim to be their ""rights"". When they endanger the principles of international order, such as the sovereignty of States, the legal systems of free societies, the universal freedom of the air, the physical safety of men and women who handle the international mail, then the United Nations would lose all credit and repute if its Secretary-General were not to focus its attention and conscience on the approaching abyss.
80.	It is disquieting that the inclusion of the item in the agenda was so strongly opposed that it was nearly lost. Civilized mankind should take a keen look at the Governments which opposed the inclusion of the item or advocated its long postponement. The truth is that their Organization came within a few votes of moral death last week. And the Foreign Minister of Brazil was perfectly right in deploring the General Assembly's failure to endorse the wording of the item as recommended by the General Committee [2038th meeting]. Once the deliberate and unprovoked murder of unarmed civilians is justified by reference to the murderers' ""motives"" or ""frustrations"", we might as well include murder amongst the legitimate indulgences of a permissive society and wipe the sixth commandment off the tablet of man's ethical history.
81.	The Israeli delegation will support the draft resolution presented by the United States [A/C.6/L.851] and will give careful study in an affirmative spirit to the text proposed for an international convention against terrorism [A/C.6/ L.850].
82.	But while the problem has its international aspects, especially in aviation and in police security, much depends on the willingness of individual Governments to take measures of prevention on their own soil. The terrorists are particularly active on the territory of free democratic States in which tolerance and hospitality are cherished values. It thus becomes painfully necessary for such States to develop habits of sharp detection and action which are, in a sense, contrary to their easy temperament. But a free society cannot long survive if it fails to defend itself against those who would destroy its freedom and menace its survival by illicit violence. Similarly, many a government must face a moment of agonizing truth when it is called upon to judge the results of giving the terrorists what they want under the threat of dreadful blackmail. To withstand hijackers and kidnappers requires very strong nerves. A compromise convenient for the short term will usually have the effect of giving terrorism a new lease of strength, thereby endangering more victims than are immediately at stake.
83.	In addition to the need for international and national action there is an important area for regional co-operation. The terrorists have made the liberal societies of Western Europe the main arena of their activities. It is here that the majority of outrages against vulnerable aircraft and civilian establishments have taken place. We attach importance and interest to the discussion initiated by the Federal Republic of Germany at the Council of the European Community a few weeks ago regarding measures to combat international terrorism.
84.	My Government has considered certain specific concrete proposals for international, regional and national measures to combat terrorism and we shall bring them forward at the appropriate Committee stage.
85.	It is of course right and inevitable that the item on our agenda [item 92] should be drafted in universal terms. It would, however, be mere pretense to lose sight of the fact that the most rampant terrorism today is that which has its root in Arab hostility to Israel. It was after all the ghastly crime at Munich that gave the incentive for the debate which the General Assembly has decided to hold.
86.	In this context I come to discuss the methods used by Arab terrorist organizations; their political aims; and, above all, the crucial role of Arab Governments in creating and maintaining them.
87.	The original targets of Arab terrorism in the early 1950s were the lives and homes of Israelis on their own soil. The toll was heavy and constant. A bus load of passengers at Scorpion Pass; a group of farmers celebrating a wedding at Patish; a party of scholars on an archaeological expedition at Ramat Rachel; farmers in the collective villages of the Jordan Valley; fishermen on Lake Tiberias. These are random extracts from our nation's memory of bereavement. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual security. A United Nations representative, General E. L. M. Burns of Canada, wrote then of these fedayeen activities that they were worthy of the Nazis. In those days murder was not regarded anywhere as a symptom of revolutionary ""progress"".
88.	The terrorist bands called the ""fedayeen"", which, thereafter, became the ""Palestine Liberation Organization"", developed their main activity in the 1950s and the early 1960s. In other words, they have absolutely nothing to do with the situation created by the 1967 war. Their object has been and is to destroy security of life for Israel, irrespective of what the armistice or cease-fire configuration is at any given time. After 1967 they transferred their violence from frontier areas to Israel's urban centers; shoppers in Mahne Yehuda Market in Jerusalem; housewives in a supermarket; students in a college cafeteria; passers-by in a crowded bus station-and on one horrifying morning a clearly marked school bus at Avivim in Northern Israel. As the mangled bodies of our children, still clutching toys and copybooks, were flown by helicopter to hospitals and morgues, there came across the frontier the gloating voice of Mr. George Habash, Commander of the so-called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, announcing that it was wise to kill Israelis while they were still young. It is difficult to speak or hear of this morbid monster without a cold chill of revulsion. The essential point for these ""liberators"" is that their victims should be defenseless, vulnerable and unarmed. This is their chivalry.
89.	The rest is part of the recent experience and memory of everyone in this hall. Before the squalid butchery at Munich, the worst horror was at Lod Airport, where a group of depraved mercenaries from a distant land methodically slaughtered 26 civilian passengers-one of them was an eminent Israeli physicist, others were humble Puerto Rican pilgrims coming from the United States. Condemnation was world-wide; but alas it was not universal. Those who take their weekly instruction from the cultivated prose of Hassanein Heykal should ponder his commentary on the massacre at Lod. I quote from an article by him dated 9 June 1972:
""If there had been three Palestinians there instead of three Japanese I should have been enthusiastic about it, in spite of the fact that at the bottom of my heart I'm for the three Japanese.""
90.	The Egyptian Prime Minister's reaction was less sophisticated and more simple, although it had a note of blasphemy. He invoked divine blessing on the murderous example:
""I want to say that what happened at Lod Airport proves that we can, with Allah's help, achieve victory in our battle with Israel. This is the only reaction I have to this matter.""
91.	In the history of revolutionary violence there is a constant clash between ends and means. But in the Arab terrorist movement, dedicated to enslavement and genocide, there is no such ambivalence. The aims which Arab terrorism serves are even worse than the means it employs. The means are murder and kidnapping. The aim is not to win freedom for the Arab nation, whose freedom is so
amply and lavishly assured, but to liquidate the national? liberation which the most ancient of nations has already achieved.
92.	There is no need of interpretation here. Quotation is enough. The Palestine terrorist organizations are not at all concerned with finding a solution for the problems of Palestinian Arabs within the framework of a Middle East of which Israel forms a part. This, in fact, is what they are fighting to prevent. The aim is much more radical. Let their leader, Yasser Arafat, speak for himself:
""Al Fatah started its activities in 1956 and its armed struggle in 1965. Its aim is the liquidation of the Zionist Israeli existence.""
President El-Sadat is often very frank on this theme. On 2 June 1971 he told the Egyptian National Council:
""The Zionist conquest to which we are being subjected will not be terminated by the return of the occupied territories. This is a new Crusader war which will persist during our generation and through the coming one.""
93.	A document called the Palestine Covenant was adopted by all the Palestine liberation groups at the sixth congress of the Palestinian National Council, which met in Cairo in September 1968. The Covenant lays down that the Palestine State is to be an Arab State, that it is to comprise the whole area west of the Jordan not part of it, and that only Jews who were living in Palestine before the ""Zionist invasion"" could be citizens. The rest -the vast majority- would be pressed to depart. So the aim of this terrorist movement is the liquidation of the solitary Israeli State for the purpose of establishing the nineteenth Arab State. A compact expression of this policy came from former Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad in a press conference in Paris on 1 October 1971, when he said: ""I give complete support to the organizations and their program of wiping out the Jewish State.""
94.	The concept of ""politicide""-the extinction of the identity and personality of a State-is so unfamiliar, indeed unique, that it may be difficult for other Governments to grasp its significance. Israelis study this notion against the background of another unique experience, the memory of which no other people has ever shared. In the Hitler decade we learned that some things are too terrible to believe but that nothing in our people's history is too terrible to have happened.
95.	In questioning Israel's axiomatic right to security and independence, the terrorist organizations commit a disruptive heresy in the life of our age. They rise up in revolt against history, law, justice, humanity and peace. There are now 18 Arab States, with a population of 100 million, an area of 4-1/2 million square miles and unlimited wealth and opportunity. Facing them alone on the scales of equity is the small State of Israel. There is, therefore, only one nation which stands or falls in history by the way in which this conflict is resolved. By-its solitude and uniqueness, Israel's secure existence is the overriding moral imperative in this dispute. The moral quality of the Arab terrorist organizations is determined not only by their brutal acts but by the destructive vision which inspires them. Their
close links with neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations are in full harmony with their inner nature.
96.	I have said that the resurgence of Arab terrorism is a massive obstacle or the road to peace. This is not only a reflection on the psychological atmosphere. *t is true that a condition of hate, fear, bloodshed and bereavement works against the prospect of a conciliatory effort, which would be difficult enough in any case. What is no less grave is tha we find it impossible to accept the distinction between these organizations and the Arab Governments which are our destined partners in the peace effort. The support given by those Governments to the organizations undermines the credibility of their peaceful professions and even the professions are few and far between.
97.	Egyptian support for the terrorists finds expression in the press, radio and television. The terrorist leaders see Cairo as the center at which they co-ordinate matters of common concern with the League of Arab States. Egypt serves as the center where the heads of the terrorist movements meet the representatives of the various Arab countries passing through Cairo. Not a week passes without a central Egyptian personality meeting with a terrorist leader for co-ordination and co-operation. Cairo Radio gives a special program on Palestine in which terrorist activities are constantly praised. The special radio station broadcasting from Cairo, called ""Saut Falastin"", belongs entirely to the terrorists, who are free to broadcast what they like. The station broadcasts constant agitation and incitement against Israel and justifies every terrorist action.
98.	Egyptian support on the military level is very broad. On many occasions delegations of the organizations with Arafat at their head pay visits to Egyptian army camps in the rear and at the front. Arafat wears an Egyptian army decoration for valor.
99.	The terrorist organizations are permitted to carry on activity everywhere in the country to mobilize volunteers. Apart from their own independent mobilization machinery, they receive active support in this respect from the Libyan Embassy in Cairo, which openly signs up volunteers, pays them and sends them to Libya for training.
100.	Delegations from the various terrorist organizations receive information and instruction in Egyptian military bases. The Fatah stands apart from the rest and has special privileges in Egypt. Its members actually go through training together with Egyptian soldiers in the ranks of the Egyptian army. The ""Ein Jalud"" unit of the Palestine Liberation Army is commanded by an Egyptian officer. Egypt also helps the organizations with supplies of arms, ammunition and other military material.
101.	The crisis that broke out between Lebanon and the terrorists in June 1972 brought to the fore Egypt's role as guardian and protector of the organizations. Realizing that the terrorist movement might find itself obliged to quit Lebanese territory, the Egyptian President took action to forestall any Lebanese attempt to harm the terrorists. Mahmoud Riad, Secretary of the League of Arab States, was sent as a special mediator. President El-Sadat was not content with that. He sent his personal representative to Beirut in order to exert pressure on the Lebanese Government not to cancel the Cairo agreement of November 1969, which provided for the terrorists' presence in Lebanon.
102.	Egypt's leaders address the terrorist bodies at all their conferences. In any clash between the terrorists and their victims, the Government sponsors the terrorists' cause. In September 1970 a Pan American aircraft landed in Cairo, where the hijackers calmly blew it up in the sight of the authorities. When the Jordanian Defense Minister was murdered as a guest on Egyptian soil, his hosts allowed the murderers to go free.
103.	In Lebanon there are 5,000 terrorists, whose constant activity is undisturbed by the authorities. Under the Cairo agreement between Lebanon and the terrorist organizations, the Lebanese Government granted the terrorists legal recognition, freedom to organize and a base for activity against Israel. Beirut is the seat and center of terrorist planning and propaganda. It is from Beirut that groups set out with detailed plans to commit murder and hijackings and set off explosions in Europe and elsewhere. It was in Beirut and Baalbek that Kozo Okamoto received shelter and training for his assault on the airport at Lod.
104.	Syria was the first Arab State which supported terrorist activities from the outset. President Al-Assad said on 2 September 1971 in the weekly journal Al Mussawar that:
""... the fedayeen are to be found in more than one area of Syria, and they have absolute freedom of movement on the Syrian front. Moreover,""-said President Al-Assad-""we encourage and stimulate them and often we complain that they are not sufficiently active . . ."".
105.	Libyan support for terrorist assaults in the Middle East and Europe needs no documentation. President Qaddafi's admiration of the Munich murderers was rhapsodic and explicit.
106.	Whatever the position may be with other terrorist groups, there is no truth or value in a discussion of Arab terrorism which does not face the fact that it is a recognized arm of Arab Governments in a policy of war against Israel. These organizations could not exist, still less function, without the shelter, support, endorsement, financial aid, arms, training facilities and territorial bases supplied by certain Arab States. All the activities of these organizations without exception violate the principles which the signatories of the Charter including Arab signatories-pledged themselves to defend. It is not an accident that the Governments which sponsor Arab terrorist organizations are unable to fulfill normal international obligations. The Arab Governments have not signed the Tokyo Convention;  they have not signed the Montreal Convention;? they have not responded to the Secretary-General's proposal for drawing the attention of the twenty-seventh session of this Assembly to the problem of international terrorism [A/8791 andAdd.lJ.
107.	Now. whether or not the General Assembly can take effective action in this matter, it does at least possess the capacity of accurate judgment. Such honorable words as ""liberation"", ""resistance"", ""commando"" have no application and have never before been applied to attempts to liquidate a lawful sovereignty, to compound the Nazi assault on Jewish survival and to wage a campaign of indiscriminate assault against civilians in the Middle East and elsewhere.
108.	The attitude of Arab Governments towards Arab terrorists is today a graver obstacle to peace than the admittedly disparate positions of the parties to the problems of withdrawal, boundaries, navigation, peace, etc. I say in all frankness: I cannot today believe that Egypt and Syria are willing, or that Lebanon is able, to make peace with Israel; and in that profound skepticism the attitude of those movements to terrorism plays the central role.
109.	The discussion must inevitably take us back to a consideration of the word ""Palestine"" that appears as the title of the terrorist organizations. Now, is it true that there is a distinct people deprived of self-determination, languishing in poverty, squalor and humiliation, dependent on organized violence as its sole prospect of redemption? Nothing could be further from the truth.
110.	There are some 2-3/4 million Palestine Arabs in the world today. Three quarters of them are in the original territory of Palestine, on both sides of the Jordan that is to say, under Jordanian rule or within the area at present under Israel's jurisdiction. The other quarter are in Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, 1,300,000 Palestine Arabs now hold Jordanian citizenship, which has been available to them since 1950, when Jordan annexed the territories of the west bank with the consent of the Palestinian leaders.
111.	For the entire period of the armistice regime between 1949 and 1967 all Palestine Arabs-except a few hundred thousand who are citizens of Israel were living under Arab sovereignty and Arab flags. In other words, the question of their civic and political identity was a matter for determination by Arab Governments and authorities alone.
112.	The Kingdom of Jordan was a Palestinian State, in the double sense that a majority of its citizens were Palestinians and a majority of all the Palestinians in the world were citizens of that State.
113.	In a final peace settlement a new permanent boundary will be drawn between Israel and its eastern neighbor. Some hundreds of thousands of Palestine Arabs would in all conditions be a community within the State of Israel; this is normal. There is no such thing as 100 per cent self- determination, although the Arab nation comes closer to that figure than any other in history. Those Palestinian Arabs who will be outside Israel's permanent boundary once it is drawn will be free to determine their future in conjunction with the Arab Governments and peoples concerned.
114.	As recently as 8 September 1972, the Israeli Prime Minister made it plain that in her conception of a peace agreement there would have to be important modifications of the previous armistice lines in order to preserve security and to avoid new wars. But she added that it was not her conception that under such an agreement the vast majority of all the Palestine Arabs in the administered territories would have to fall within Israeli jurisdiction.
115.	It follows, therefore, that the political status of the Palestine Arabs would find its solution within a peace settlement. Now, here is the most drastic paradox of all: the ""Palestine Liberation"" organizations are the implacable opponents of an Arab peace with Israel. Yet nothing but peace with Israel can clarify the political and civil destiny of the Palestine Arabs in a manner compatible with Israel's sovereignty and security, with regional peace and with their own basic interests.
116.	In the meantime, this community is not languishing in despair and poverty: there is a new freedom of movement and contact. The national product of the Samaria-Judea-Gaza areas, administered by Israel since 1967, in which a million Arabs live, has nearly doubled since 1968. The per capita income has risen from £1 670 in 1968 to £1 1,100 in 1972. The agricultural product has tripled. There were less than 4,000 private vehicles in 1969; there are nearly 7,000 today. There were 3,000 television sets there in 1967; today there are 40,000. Fifty thousand workers find labor opportunities in the Israeli market, from which they bring back £ 1300 million a year. There is no unemployment. Wage levels have trebled since 1967. The value of exports from these territories has risen from £ 1220 million to £ 1305 million.
117.	Perhaps more significant than the language of statistics is the spectacle of human contact, commerce and exchange that brings hundreds of thousands of Israelis and hundreds of thousands of Palestine Arabs into a normal and fruitful communion the like of which never existed before.
118.	In the latter half of 1971, 200,000 Arabs from neighboring countries freely crossed the Jordan bridges towards Israel. It is not inconceivable that, when the agreed peace boundary is drawn, the relations between Israel and its eastern Arab neighbors could evolve across open boundaries into something like the community structure in parts of Western Europe today.
119.	So while Arab terrorists in Beirut and European capitals manufacture their bombs and plot their assassinations, the majority of the Palestinian Arabs are living solid lives enriched by a widening contact with their neighbors still clouded, of course, by a lack of political definition, but nevertheless alive with the hope and prospect of a peaceful regional future.
120.	There is, of course, hardship in every sector of Middle Eastern life. But there is not one single problem of the Palestinian Arabs that can be advanced towards a solution by the action of the terrorist groups. There is not one single legitimate interest of the Palestinian Arabs that would not come to reasonable satisfaction in a negotiated peace settlement between Israel and its neighbors. The terrorist groups are not only the enemies of law and order across the Middle East and in many parts of the world: they also alienate the Palestine Arabs from their true interest and their authentic vocation.
121.	The problem of curbing the terrorists is now our most urgent preoccupation. We are resolved to resist and weaken them in our region. We believe that national, regional and international action against Arab terrorism is an indispensable prelude to the fruitful exploration of peaceful prospects for the Middle East.
122.	I have spoken of psychological and human obstacles on the road to peace. Some of these obstacles could easiK be removed. I refer, for example, to the problem of prisoners of war.
123.	There are 10 Israeli prisoners of war in Egyptian hands; they have been there for two and a half to three years. On the other hand, Israel holds 61 Egyptian prisoners of war, most of whom have been in captivity for nearly three years. Syria has been holding three Israeli prisoners of war for the last two and a half years. Israel holds 45 Syrian prisoners of war. Israel also holds 10 Lebanese prisoners of war.
124.	With the cease-fire well into its third year we propose the mutual release and repatriation of all prisoners of war. The arithmetical advantage is overwhelmingly on the Arab side; but in the broader human sense everyone would gain.
125.	The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of 12 August 1949 lays down in article 118 that: ""Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities."" This provision of the Geneva Convention is clear and definite. In accordance with it there should have been a release of prisoners when the cease-fire entered into force on 7 August 1970.
126.	Articles 109 and 110 of the Convention provide that prisoners of war who are seriously wounded or who are seriously sick must be sent back to their own country even before the cessation of active hostilities.
127.	It is reported that Egypt considers the six pilots amongst the Israeli prisoners that it has captured as being of greater importance than the 60 Egyptian prisoners held by Israel, who are mostly ordinary soldiers. But this is certainly not a humane approach to the problem. All prisoners of war, irrespective of rank, must be released in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Geneva Convention. A gesture of goodwill by Egypt and Syria on behalf of 115 Arabs and 13 Israeli prisoners would help diminish the acute lack of confidence which now obstructs any progress towards peace. What valid argument can there possibly be against this course?
128.	At the same time our Jewish destiny and responsibility inspire our concern for the plight of the small Jewish minority in Syria where 4,500 Jews are held as helpless hostages, forbidden to depart, discriminated against, humiliated, their movement restricted, essential services denied them, their property confiscated, and their livelihood in constant jeopardy.
129.	The plight of Syrian Jewry has been brought to the United Nations General Assembly and its Committees in the past. Two years ago committees to help the Jews of the Arab countries arose in 25 different countries in four continents, and an international committee came into existence. Some of the Arab countries responded to the humanitarian pressure of world public opinion and permitted the Jews who had remained in their territories to leave. Only Syria has persisted in its present position. Public opinion should not rest or remain silent until the imprisoned are released and the Jews of Syria permitted to reach safety.
130.	Year in and year out the problem of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union comes to the General Assembly and its Committees.
131.	The history of the Jews in Russia is a continuous chain of hardship and suffering from the days of the Tsars until the present time. Recently their urgent aspiration to emigrate to their historic homeland has broken through the barrier of silence. Thousands have reached Israel, where they have been received with a deep poignancy arising from a long separation. Many people of goodwill throughout the world saw in the emigration of these Jews, however few, a sign of broader tolerance and humane understanding.
132.	But there has now been a setback; while still permitting the emigration of thousands of Jews, the Soviet authorities have placed limitations on the freedom of movement of scores of thousands in disregard of their fundamental human rights. Many have been arrested just for wishing to go to Israel and have been sentenced to imprisonment. The Soviet information media publish calumnies, slanders and incitement against them.
133.	Many of those who register in the emigration offices are dismissed from employment and thus lose their livelihood. An open anti-Semitic campaign is being conducted, and in the period 1971-1972 alone, dozens of anti-Semitic books have been published in the Soviet Union, in addition to the anti-Jewish campaign conducted by the press and official media of information.
134.	And now as part of the attempt to dissuade Jews from submitting applications for exit permits to Israel, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics decided on 3 August to impose a special tax on Jews with higher education who wish to go to Israel. This effectively deprives thousands of people of any possibility and any hope ever to join their families and to realize their national aspiration. A scale has been established for each level of education, sometimes reaching $25,000 and more per person.
135.	It seems to us that the Soviet argument on the brain drain is not relevant or applicable here. The Soviet Union is not one of the needy developing countries, and Israel is not offering Jewish members of the scientific professions who come from the Soviet Union superior financial rewards. Israel is only able to give them a home, where they will feel as Jews who are not being discriminated against.
136.	Likewise irrelevant is the argument that graduates are obliged, as it were, to repay the cost of their education.
137.	The noted Soviet demographer, Urlanis, states in an article published on 26 July 1970 in Literaturnaya Gazeta that, in the conditions obtaining in the Soviet Union, the average university graduate repays by four years' work the State's investment in his training. The majority of scientists have thus already repaid that investment many times over by their creativity, their invention, their research and their professional work. The decree is not only a harassment of thousands of Jews, it is a serious infringement of intellectual freedom and scientific liberty. It creates the enslavement of scientists and intellectuals whose only crime is that they have studied and worked and contributed to the progress of their country, and today obey the call of their historic consciousness and wish to pursue their intellectual and social vocation elsewhere.
138.	Scientific personalities and institutions across the world have reacted with astonishment and indignation to this limitation of intellectual freedom. It is precisely because we wish to see a greater harmony between East and West, between the Soviet Union and the West, in all fields, including that of science, that we raise our voice in protest against this superfluous obstacle to international understanding.
139.	The General Assembly moves towards its agenda in an atmosphere of crisis for international institutions. There was never a time when a universal framework for international relations was more objectively necessary than today. Yet the concept of international organization is still surrounded by apathy and doubt. The United Nations should act with consistent purpose within the real limits of its capacity and strength. It should reinforce its role in international development in the light of the difficulties and dislocations revealed at the third session of UNCTAD in Santiago. It should take a careful course on the problems of the environment which were impressively brought to light at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in June. We must not allow an exaggerated ecological alarmist to act as a brake on accelerated development: for poverty and backwardness in most of the world have a more polluting effect on the life of our age than the excesses of industrialization in a small part of it. We should complete it universality by the admission of Bangladesh to membership. And we must not discredit our protest against racial discrimination in the southern parts of Africa by a craven silence about the brutal and capricious persecution of Asians undertaken by the present ruler of Uganda. The distribution of tasks and responsibilities between sovereign Governments and international institutions requires a delicate exercise in understanding. The United Nations must become an instrument for solving conflicts, not an arena for waging them. It should take a diplomatic, not a parliamentary view. Its task is to provide and promote consensus and agreement, not to take refuge in illusions of enforcement or adjudication. If we temper ambition with restraint we may yet endow this Organization with a constructive purpose and enlarge its humane role in the history of our turbulent age."
4,1976,"ISR_prev_1998","Permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in the general debate to proffer to you, Sir, the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your unanimous election to the high and responsible office of President of the General Assembly.
122.	I also tender my delegation's good wishes to Mr. Gaston Thorn, who presided over the deliberations of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly with such distinction, and to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for his devotion and assiduity in the performance of his onerous duties.
123.	What is the aspect of the'United Nations as it enters into its fourth decade? Physically, the Organization works well. One must ask, however, if the principles of the United Nations Charter, as they were determined in San Francisco 31 years ago, have proved equally resilient; if intellectually and morally the United Nations has withstood the test of experience -the experience of a generation which, although it has been spared the devastation of a world war, has still seen major armed conflict, massacre, political terrorism, slavery, tyranny, persecution, hunger and poverty in all too many areas on the surface of the globe for every minute the United Nations has been in existence. Regrettably, the answer must be negative.
124.	It is indisputable that world public opinion has become increasingly disenchanted with the United Nations; increasingly frustrated by the opportunism and hypocrisy of so much of its debates and decisions; increasingly disgusted by the power of a mechanical majority to bend the Organization to its own purposes, by, for example, transforming an initiative designed to outlaw terrorism into an apologia for terrorism; or by converting the Commission on Human Rights into a forum in which the guilty are the accusers and the innocent condemned, In the twisted terminology which is used here a defeated aggressor is portrayed as a victim, a successful defender as an aggressor; those who refuse to treat with their neighbors are hailed as lovers of peace, and those who seek peace negotiations branded as warmongers.
125.	The list of discrepancies between the current practices of the United Nations and what the Charter says is long, and there is no need to labor the point.
126.	To a great extent the General Assembly has become an arena for empty rhetoric and arbitrary recommendations which have little to do with right, justice and international reality. Indeed, there appears to be no limit to the absurdity which the General Assembly, as it operates today, can reach it even achieved a record in futility by adopting, at the same session, two conflicting resolutions on the same subject.
127.	Two further examples from the record of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly demonstrate that clearly. One is the ludicrous and evil attempt to stigmatize the national liberation movement of the Jewish people as racism and racial discrimination; the other is the bizarre episode of the Committee of 20 members, from the resolution which the General Assembly was not competent to adopt; through the biased and non-representative com-position of the Committee itself, to the report of the Committee which is not only a flagrant intervention in the domestic jurisdiction of a Member State but also a prescription for its dismemberment by stages.
128.	History will consign these resolutions to oblivion, and those countries which supported their adoption will bear the shame.
129.	But the United Nations system is an essential feature of the international scene of our times and it is hardly possible to conceive of a world without it. It must be cured, however, of the grave maladies which afflict it: there must be a return to the Charter; there must be an end to the rancorous confrontation which is the dominant feature of our deliberations; consultation and agreement must be restored to their primary place; the United Nations, and particularly the specialized agencies, must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they are being dragged by Arab obsessions about Israel, so that they may devote themselves to the social, humanitarian, scientific and technical tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform very well when they are allowed to do so; and, lastly, there must be full participation of all Members in all United Nations activities on an equitable basis, by strict alphabetical rotation, instead of the discriminatory bloc system.
130.	The effort to bring into being a new order in international economic and trade relations has become a major focus of interest and debate throughout the world and in the United Nations system.
131.	Israel belongs to a small group of countries in the developing world which, though meagerly endowed by nature, have by hard work and the application of science and technology reached a promising level of development.
These countries have a special role to play because they show what can be done even in the most difficult of circumstances.
132.	It is thus important, I believe, that developing countries consider not only what the fortunate countries of the industrialized world can do for them but what they can do for themselves and what they can do for one another. As our sage Hillel taught some 2000 years ago: ""If I am not for myself, who will be for me; but if I am only for myself, what am I; and if not now, when? ""
133.	For our part we have tried, at the seventh special session and at the fourth session of UNCTAD, to present some ideas which some delegations found useful and constructive.
134.	What we can best do is to put our experience in overcoming some of the major problems which beset a large part of the developing world at the disposal of all who wish to avail themselves of it. For many years now it has been the policy of the Government of Israel to conduct programs of technical co-operation with other emerging and developing countries and, indeed, it is a source of pride to us that, with all the limitations which nature has imposed on us, and saddled as we are with tremendous burdens caused by the absence of a peace settlement in the Middle East, we are at this very moment co-operating in one technical field or another with over 50 countries represented in this hall.
135.	One such important field is water development in semi-arid climates. In view of the forthcoming United Nations water and desertification conferences scheduled to take place next year, the practical experience of Israel in water exploration and management as well as in the development of highly efficient methods of irrigation, which has already aroused much interest in a number of countries with similar problems to our own, might well prove to be susceptible of wider application.
136.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has just concluded its fifth session here in New York, and it is a matter of some disquiet that it has not achieved any significant progress in the direction of an acceptable international agreement.
137.	The trend towards unilateral decisions by individual States concerning the increase in the width of their territorial sea or the proclamation of economic zones is asserting itself without a parallel international reaffirmation of proper rules to guarantee the essential freedom of navigation and overflight on the seas and through and over straits. This is a regrettable situation which cannot but result in an increase in international tensions.
138.	Another problem which is still without solution is that presented by the lofty idea that the sea-bed beyond the economic zones constitutes the common heritage of mankind. A realistic compromise between this concept and its practical application for the benefit of all nations is still apparently far away.
139.	A goodly number of representatives who have spoken before me have raised their voices in condemnation of
international terrorism, which these last few years has spread over the face of the earth like a malignant cancer.
140.	There is no excuse for terrorism. No cause can justify or condone it. It is a criminal activity, totally indiscriminate in its effects, which by design strikes at the very elements of the population that every society tries to protect-the innocent, the weak, the defenseless, children and women.
141.	The record of the United Nations in combating terrorism is dismal. In 1972, after the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games by a gang of Arab terrorists, the Secretary-General proposed an item for the agenda of the General Assembly on measures to prevent terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardize fundamental freedoms.7 We all know what happened to that praise-worthy venture: it was deliberately sabotaged by a group of States whose interest was not to prevent terrorism but to encourage, aid and abet it on the evident assumption that, because it seemed to serve their own interests, they would be immune from harm.
142.	They were grievously mistaken. Nobody is immune; and some of the States whose representatives were the most eloquent in thwarting any effective United Nations action have themselves been victims of terrorism in the past few weeks-Yugoslavia, India; Egypt and even Syria. Ilie item, now distorted so as to appear like an apology for and justification of terrorism instead of a call for action to suppress it, is still on the agenda of the General Assembly, but is is conceded by all that nothing will ever come of it.
143.	The issue is a fundamental one for the international community, for the attitude this Organization takes on the question of terrorism is a very clear reflection of its moral strength and international responsibility.
144.	The terrorism of today is especially deadly for three principal reasons: the availability to terrorists of sophisticated modern weapons capable of causing mass loss of life and destruction; the complicity of certain States which supply these weapons, frequently delivered in their diplomatic bags, and which provide the terrorists with shelter and comfort; and the abhorrent practice of taking innocent hostages as a means of blackmail.
145.	The rescue by Israel in July of the hostages hijacked to Entebbe in the Air France airbus has shown that given the will it is possible for even a small State to combat terrorism effectively. However, operations such as that would not be necessary if potential hijackers and terrorists knew that nowhere in the world would they get refuge and support.
146.	Israel thus welcomes the proposal made on 28 September by the Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany that the United Nations should draft a convention banning the taking of hostages internationally and providing for the prosecution or extradition of the perpetrators f 7th meeting, para. 113]: This is an important step in the right direction and the General Assembly would lose all credibility as an effective international instrumentality if it failed to take it.
147.	But in view of the extreme gravity of the problem and the sorry performance of the United Nations in dealing with it, we would be deluding ourselves if we imagined that that would be enough. Only by close multilateral co-operation and concerted organized action between States which really intend to fight terrorism will this atrocious crime be suppressed.
148.	The enemies of Israel in this Organization strive mightily to convince the world of similarities between Zionism and apartheid, and make much of the relations between Israel and South Africa to bolster a fraudulent case. Racism and racial discrimination, in any guise, including apartheid, are abhorrent to my country and my people. The basic tenets of Judaism are irreconcilable with any form of racial discrimination. The Jews are the classic victims of racial discrimination and over the centuries our martyrs have run into the tens of millions.
149.	It is equally specious to single out Israel for links with South Africa when most of the world maintains links with that country. According to the latest available statistics, the foreign trade of South Africa totaled over $12 billion in 1974. Of this huge sum Israel's share was less than two fifths of 1 per cent-infinitely smaller than the share of many Arab and some African countries. The armed forces of the Republic are large and equipped with modern weapons -tanks, artillery, aircraft, destroyers and submarines. It is not Israel that supplied them.
150.	In my address to the General Assembly last year  I stated that as far as Israel was concerned we had two criteria for judgment on the policy of detente which was given formal expression in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Those criteria are that detente must apply to the Middle East no less than to Europe and to other areas of the world, and that the humanitarian provisions of the Helsinki agreement must be scrupulously applied. On both counts detente has been a grievous disappointment to us.
151.	I declare that detente has not been felt in the Middle East. Moreover, I regret to record that there has been no improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Exit from the Soviet Union-a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki agreement-is still severely restricted, while those Jews who do insist on their rights are subject to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment, and in some cases to arrest and imprisonment. I once again call on the Government of the Soviet Union to permit those Jews who wish to leave in order to join their families in Israel to do so.
152.	The situation of the Jews of Syria remains tragic: a small community continues to be held as a hostage. Jews are victims of persecution and oppression, are circumscribed in their movements inside Syria, while travel abroad is permitted only under severe restrictions. Surely these 5,000 men, women and children cannot make all that difference to the Government of Syria. Why is it holding them?
153.	When I spoke in the General Assembly last year the war in Lebanon was but six months old. At that time some 5,000 people had already been killed and nearly 18,000 wounded. Twelve months have passed since then; the carnage goes on. By now over 40,000 men, women and children have lost their lives and over 100,000 have been wounded-and this out of a total population of less than 2.5 million. A rough equivalent would be a toll of killed and wounded totaling some 13 million in the United States, 15 million in the Soviet Union and 3 million in France. The ruin and devastation are almost beyond description; most of the flourishing towns and villages of Lebanon have become a bloody and merciless wasteland.
154.	For a year and a half a Member State of the United Nations has been bleeding to death before the eyes of the whole world. At the beginning it was claimed that this was a civil war, and thus outside the purview of the Security Council. No one produces this specious argument now, when massive armed intervention by regular and irregular foreign Arab troops is known and admitted-Syrians, Iraqis and Libyans, to mention only the larger contingents. But not a word from the Security Council, not a whisper.
155.	The silence of the world Organization in the face of this tragedy is an awful warning to all small States. It is clear that a country which relies on the United Nations for its security, a country which cannot defend itself by its own means, is lost.
156.	There is yet another conclusion to be drawn. For years now the world has been bombarded by a propaganda campaign peddling the notion of the replacement of Israel by a so-called secular democratic State where Muslims, Christians and Jews would live in blissful amity. But where is this beautiful mirage now? Destroyed in the fires of Lebanon, by the same gangs of terrorists who are the prime instigators of the blood-letting there in Lebanon.
157.	Israel is an immediate neighbor of Lebanon, and what goes on there concerns us closely. Our overriding desire is that peace and tranquility should be restored to Lebanon, for that is the essential condition for the reaffirmation of the national independence and the territorial integrity of that unhappy land. Moreover, we expect that the future constitutional structure of Lebanon will* be determined by the citizens of Lebanon in their respective communities, and by them alone; that foreign troops, both regular and irregular, will leave the country; and, above all, that Lebanon will not again become a base for attacks on Israel and its people.
158.	But the Lebanese conflict, although the most grave, is not the only current conflict in which countries of the Arab world are engaged. There are many others. A random listing makes, indeed, extraordinary reading.
159.	There is the bitter quarrel between Iraq and Syria. Then comes Iraq's designs on the territorial integrity of, Kuwait; Democratic Yemen's quarrel with Oman, with Yemen and with Saudi Arabia; Somalia's designs on Ethiopia; Egypt's conflict with Syria; Libya's clashes with
Egypt, with Sudan, with Tunisia, with Syria, with Chad and with practically every other independent State in the Arab world and in North Africa; and, finally, the feud between Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania in the Sahara desert.
160.	There is only one island of stability in this stormy sea, and that is the State of Israel.
161.	There is clearly a moral to be drawn here. The neighbors of Israel know that their border with Israel is the safest border they have. They know that if they preserve the peace on the borders with Israel then their own borders are secure. Moreover, their people know full well that when they are in distress they can turn to Israel for humanitarian assistance, as the villagers of South Lebanon are doing this day at the fence of goodwill.
162.	In my speech last year I drew attention to a problem of particular gravity for the prospects of peace as well as for the economic and social well-being of the countries of the Middle East. I refer to the seemingly limitless flow of weapons of war into the region, resulting in a frantic arms race. In the past three years the value of arms supplies delivered by both East and West to the Arab countries in the vicinity of Israel is estimated at $7.5 billion; a further approximately $22 billion worth is contracted for delivery from the end of 1976 onwards, making a total of nearly $30 billion invested in weaponry. This is an utterly staggering sum which is difficult for the human mind to take in. If, instead of being spent on means of destruction, most of this sum was invested in the economic and social development of the area, the Middle East would be transformed and restored to its ancient glory.
163.	However, as long as the Arab States continue to arm themselves with highly sophisticated modern weaponry on this vast scale, Israel is compelled to keep up, and will keep up. But we repeat emphatically that we are prepared now, even before peace is made, to negotiate with our neighbors for a balanced limitation of the inflow of arms into the area in such a manner that the burden will be lightened for all without adversely affecting the security and the defense capacity of any.
164.	It causes us no joy that the Middle East is ablaze with conflict, because the peace that we seek is its principal victim. Therefore, in order to keep up the momentum following on the successful conclusion of the 1974 separation of forces agreements with Egypt and Syria and the 1975 agreement with Egypt, we have tried to take additional steps in the direction of a just and lasting peace in the area.
165.	We have proposed that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East be reconvened with its original membership. The proposal was torpedoed by the USSR, Syria and Egypt. When it was intimated to us that there was no chance at this time for an overall peace treaty and the normalization of relations, we responded favorably to a United States suggestion to negotiate agreements on the termination of the state of war. This proposal has remained without response or acknowledgment from the Arab side to this day. As far as we are concerned, this possibility still exists.
166.	Israel wants peace, seeks peace and is ready for peace at any time-a peace which will emerge from the region itself, which will break down the wall of hostility dividing the States of the region and which will be shaped by free negotiations between them. We believe that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) form the only agreed basis both for the nature of the peace and for the method of achieving it. For that reason we are ready to take part in a reconvened Geneva Peace Conference, with its original composition, at any time acceptable to all. At such a conference, or by any other means which the parties find satisfactory, we would hope to negotiate with each of our neighbors a final peace settlement based on a fair compromise which, on the one hand, will provide Israel with defensible borders, and, on the other, will satisfy genuine Arab interests, including, within the context of the settlement with our neighbor to the east, a just and constructive solution to the problem of Palestinian Arab identity. Only a peace which serves the interests of Israel and its neighbors will endure.
167.	Peace is the foremost objective of Israel, and its Government will not be deflected from the constant effort required to attain it."
4,1975,"ISR_prev_1998","33.	 Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I join the many representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth session of the General Assembly. You bring to this high office qualities of integrity, intellect and experience which have already carried you to the summit of political responsibility in your own country as well as on the wider European stage. The General Assembly is indeed fortunate that its leader for the coming 12 months will be a statesman deeply loyal to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
34.	The annual general debates at the General Assembly provide an occasion for a survey of the working of the international system during the preceding year, and for the public expression of the hopes and fears, the expectations and anxieties, of the Governments representing almost the totality of the population of the world. The present debate seems to me an appropriate opportunity to go a little further to look back at the 30 years of the life of the United Nations, and to try to appraise its achievements against the standards set by the founders of the Organization when they adopted the Charter in San Francisco on 26 June 1945.
35.	The United Nations was born amidst the ruin and devastation of the most terrible war experienced in the recorded history of mankind, a holocaust in' which tens of millions of men, women and children lost their lives, among them one third of the Jewish people. Its primary purposes, therefore, were to save succeeding generations from similar catastrophe and to build a better society in which fundamental human rights, equal justice before the law and economic and social advancement would be universally assured.
36 As is inevitable in human affairs, the record is uneven The most spectacular achievement of this period is unquestionably the virtual disappearance of the classic colonial system. More than half of the present Members of the United Nations, including Israel were colonial dependencies before 1945; four Cape Verde, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and Papua New Guinea achieved independence in 1975 and have been or are being admitted to membership at this session. On behalf of the people and the Government of Israel, I am happy to wish them well.
37.	The United Nations system, through the United Nations Development program and its forerunners and through the specialized agencies, has also registered noteworthy achievements in many branches of economic development, in agriculture, health, labor, transport and other practical fields. The new impetus in the development and codification of international law would hardly have been possible outside the United Nations framework; while the financial and economic organs of the United Nations family, among which one might include the recent seventh special session of the General Assembly which may well presage a new era of international economic co-operation, have become almost indispensable for the proper conduct of the world's business. Those are all positive contributions to the welfare of mankind, even though it is clear that there is still a long way to go.
38.	This is unfortunately not the case in other areas. The United Nations has manifestly not saved this generation from the scourge of war. The graves of the millions of victims of armed conflicts in Asia, in Africa, in the Middle East and even in Europe bear anguished testimony to this massive failure; while the lofty sentiments and exhortations of a multitude of conventions, declarations and resolutions have had little impact on the flagrant abuse of fundamental human rights and freedoms in vast areas of the globe.
39.	It is common form to claim that the fault does not lie in the United Nations system, but in its Members; that the world Organization merely reflects the frailties, the stupidities, the lethargy and the evils of the world itself. This is, of course, true, but it is equally true that a system that encourages contention rather than compromise, extremism rather than tolerance and confrontation rather than negotiation is hardly suited to a world as diverse in race, religion, tradition, geographical circumstances, and social and political practices as is ours.
40.	The experience of Israel is a valid example. We belong to no bloc and no alliance. We can count on little support in this Assembly, not because our cause is unjust, not because our views do not meet with sympathy, but because of considerations of unprincipled expediency. We are assaulted every year in language so venomous and vile as to defy all canons of civilized behavior. In Assembly session after Assembly session in recent years, in conference after conference, resolutions are adopted by automatic majorities, demanding that we submit to this abusive tyranny, that we, in effect, dismantle our State, and that we commit national suicide. No regard whatsoever is paid in these resolutions to truth or to reality.
41.	Israel is a democratic State, where, in accordance with our ancient tradition, all individuals and communities enjoy equality before the law and the plenitude of their human rights; yet a resolution of a United Nations body will assert the very opposite as an incontrovertible fact and condemn Israel on the basis of that falsehood.
42.	When a World Health Organization expert finds that the medical services provided for the population in the territories under Israeli administration since 1967 are as good as those of any other civilized country and that the people are healthy, a resolution of the General Conference of that specialized agency will declare that they are ridden with disease and bereft of medical attention. When a certified lunatic, not a Jew and a foreigner to boot, sets fire to part of a mosque in Jerusalem, a resolution of the Security Council condemns Israel for the deliberate desecration of that Holy Place. When highly qualified United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization experts establish that Israeli archaeological research in Jerusalem represents a notable contribution to the cultural heritage of mankind, including that of a glorious period of Islamic history, does not contravene the applicable international law and does not endanger other monuments and sites, resolutions adopted by that organization simply ignore those findings and for good measure add sanctions to the routine condemnation. And when Israel, rightly and inevitably, refuses to take notice of these fantasies, as any other Member State would do in its place, it is once again condemned for being awkward and recalcitrant and for flouting the will of the international community.
43.	Surely there is something seriously wrong with a United Nations system which is so easily subverted for political blackmail; which, instead of being a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of the objectives of the Charter, has become a propaganda battlefield; and where abuse and not reason has become the language of debate. It is surely not beyond the wit of man to arrest this hypocritical and dangerous course before it is too late.
44.	In the course of my address to the General Assembly last year, I dwelt on the positive features of the separation of forces agreements which had been concluded earlier that year between Israel and Egypt and Israel and Syria in the wake of the Yom Kippur war of October 1973.1 I expressed the view that those two agreements represented the first steps, small and hesitant though they may have been, away from the triple negatives adopted by the Conference of Arab Heads of State or Government, held at Khartoum, on 1 September 1967: no peace with Israel, no recognition, no negotiations.
45.	Those who sincerely seek peace in the Middle East will surely find cause for satisfaction in the new agreement between Egypt and Israel which was negotiated through the good offices of the President and the Secretary of State of the United States and concluded in Geneva last week. That agreement marks an important step forward. It has much greater political significance than its predecessor.
46.	I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to some of the major provisions of this agreement:
""The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of Israel have agreed that:
""The conflict between them and in the Middle East shall not be resolved by military force but by
peaceful means. 
""The parties hereby undertake not to resort to the threat or use of force or military blockade against each other. 11
""This agreement is regarded by the parties as a significant step toward a just and lasting peace. It is not a final peace agreement.
""The parties shall continue their efforts to negotiate a final peace agreement within the framework of the Geneva Peace Conference in accordance with Security Council resolution 338 (1973).
""This agreement shall enter into force upon signature of the protocol and remain in force until superseded by a new agreement.""
47.	The significance of the agreement does not lie only in the pledge of the parties to continue to observe the cease-fire and to refrain from all military or paramilitary action, or in their undertaking not to resort to the threat or use of force or military blockade, or in their recognition of the essential role of the United Nations Emergency Force and the necessity that it continue its functions, or in the provision concerning the passage of non-military cargoes to and from Israel through the Suez Canal, or even in the renunciation of war as a means to settle the differences between them; rather its significance lies in the belief that it opens a new chapter in the relations between the two countries. Israel for its part will do all it can to ensure that this new chapter will indeed be one of peace. And beyond that we hope that this agreement will pave the way to better relations and peace with all our neighbors.
48.	It is a proper opportunity to stress here that the agreement, in all its particulars, was concluded, in response to the free will of two sovereign States. If Egypt and Israel consider that the agreement is advantageous to them and, moreover, it is a step not directed against any other party nobody in this General Assembly has the right to censure it or to set himself up as an arbiter of the interests of the parties directly concerned.
49.	As I have already stated, both parties to the agreement have recognized the essential role played by the United Nations Emergency Force and I wish to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the officers and men of the Force, who are performing a difficult and delicate task in an exemplary manner; to Lieutenant General Ensio Siilasvuo, who has been identified with the peace-keeping efforts of the United Nations in the Middle East for many years and who has gained the respect and regard of all parties; and to the Secretary-General, who is ultimately responsible for this successful United Nations enterprise. I wish to include in this tribute the commanders, officers and men of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, who also play an important role in the area, and to the Governments which have contributed their personnel to all three United Nations forces.
50.	As far as we are concerned, the new agreement is not an end, but the beginning of a process of peacemaking. We do not delude ourselves that this will be a simple undertaking, for the making of peace after
so many years of hostility and 
suspicion will call for qualities of moral courage, understanding and tenacity far greater than those needed for the waging of war But the beginning must be made-for the sake of this generation and for the sake of the Israeli and Arab children who were surely born to live and create and not to die on the battlefield.
51.	Security Council resolution 338 (1973) calls for ""negotiations . . . between the parties concerned aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in 'the Middle East"". From this rostrum I declare that Israel is ready to enter into such negotiations with each and every one of the neighboring States. I note with regret repeated statements made by the leaders of Syria which reject the whole concept of a genuine peace treaty with Israel. Nevertheless, I should like to hope that this is not their last word. And for our part I solemnly reiterate that the Government of Israel is ready and willing to enter into peace negotiations with Syria without prior conditions, as called for by Security Council resolution 338 (1973), at any place and at any time.
52.	In this connexion I wish to emphasize that as far as Israel is concerned the Geneva Peace Conference can be reconvened whenever the parties are ready for it, following adequate preparation. Moreover, in principle, Israel is in favor of any mechanism which will advance the process of negotiation between the parties to the conflict. It will therefore give the idea put forward by the Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Kissinger, for an informal multilateral consultation most earnest consideration.
53.	As I emphasized in my statement at the General Assembly last year, it is self-evident that genuine peace in the Middle East must include a just and constructive solution for the Palestine Arab problem, Israel is fully alive to this problem, probably more so than the majority of those who pronounce freely upon it, and we do not require persuasion of the need to solve it peacefully and honorably. Indeed we insist that this be done. For far too long now the Palestinian Arabs have been used as a pawn on the chess-board of inter-Arab politics; throughout the years they have been the victims of Arab extremism. The solution to their problem therefore demands a change of attitude in the Arab world. The Palestine Arab problem should and can be solved in the context of a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan, which constitutes the major part of the area of historic Palestine on both sides of the river as well as being the homeland of the great majority of the Palestine Arabs.
54.	Thus if the matter at issue is a fair and constructive solution for the problem of Palestine Arab identity. Israel's response is emphatically positive. But it is categorically negative about the absurd pretensions of the so-called Palestine Liberation Organization to speak in the name of the Palestine Arabs. This congeries of feuding terrorist gangs, whose principal victims are the Arabs of Palestine themselves and whose primary aim is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the genocide of its people, is neither a valid representative of the Palestine Arab community nor a valid interlocutor for Israel.
55.	It should cause no surprise that at the spearhead of the frenzied efforts of the extreme regimes in the Arab world to prevent a political settlement of
the Middle East dispute, and to disrupt the recent agreement between Egypt and Israel, is precisely the PLO.
56.	There is nothing more fraudulent than the scheme of this faction to establish, naturally on the ruins of Israel, a so-called democratic secular State in which Moslems, Christians and Jews would, as it were, live in amity and equality. This facile slogan, this transparent propaganda gimmick, has somehow found support among naive and well-meaning people. What is the pattern which the progenitors and supporters of this idea propose to follow? For lack of anything more promising they themselves have put forward the example of Lebanon: Lebanon, which since April of this year has been torn apart by a vicious, sectarian civil war between its Moslem and Christian communities. The latest published estimate of the casualties during these past six months is more than 5,000 killed and nearly 18,000 injured. The material damage is estimated at $2,500 million. The PLO knows what it means when it talks about the democratic and secular State of Palestine. So do we. We have only to look at the more than 800,000 Jews who have left, or have been driven out of, the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa since 1948, or at the tortured existence of the 4,500-odd Jewish hostages left in Syria today, to know what the fate of the Jews of Israel would be if the PLO nightmare were realized. But we know and they know that this will never be.
57.	It is one of the anomalies of our times that Israel, which is rigorously excluded from the Middle East region in all that concerns the civilian pursuits of the United Nations and its specialized agencies such as health, education, meteorology, trade and civil aviation is emphatically held to be a part of the Middle East region when the discussion turns to military matters, including the supply of arms. If one were cynical one might almost suspect that the reason, in both cases, is to weaken Israel in one case by boycott, and in the other by depriving it of the means of defense.
58.	Be that as it may, the problem of arms control in the Middle East is real and urgent. The area is being swamped by a flood of new and sophisticated military hardware, such as it has never known in all its long history. Each month that passes raises the level of technology, and the price. Tens of billions of dollars which might otherwise be spent on economic and social development and it must be realized that the population of large parts of the Middle East is among the poorest in the world are drained off to pay for these instruments of human destruction.
59.	Israel is forced to take part in this senseless competition because, given the circumstances in the area, if it did not it would invite immediate aggression. But Israel is ready at any time, even before peace is made, to consult with its neighbors on measures to limit the arms race, with all its dangerous consequences, without materially affecting the relative defensive capacity of any of the parties to the consultation.
60.	Israel supports the proposal for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East and will be ready to enter into negotiations with all States concerned in order to attain that objective. By negotiations we mean a process of
intergovernmental consultation similar to that which preceded the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) and other international instruments of like character. We do not think that so grave a matter can be settled by correspondence through the Secretary-General.
61.	Israel welcomes the signature of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which gave formal expression to the spirit of detente. Only the future will tell if this instrument will serve as a guide for the conduct of the nations in the years to come, or whether it will remain a compilation of pious hopes, like so many international instruments which have been adopted since the end of the Second World War.
62.	In this connexion we have of course noted the following passage in the address of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union to this Assembly on 23 September: ""Assessing highly the results of the Conference, the Soviet Union believes that the main task now is to translate the understandings reached into deeds . . ."". [2357th meeting, para. 128.]
63.	As far as Israel is concerned, we have two criteria for judgment: one, that detente must apply to the Middle East no less than to Europe and to other areas of the world and so far we have seen no evidence of this; two, that the humanitarian provisions of the Final Act signed at Helsinki must be scrupulously applied. The United Kingdom Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Wilson, expressed this eloquently in his address to the Conference in these words:
""Our work here will be judged not only by the spirit of 'live and let live' which this Conference asserts. It will be judged by how that spirit is reflected in the lives of ordinary families, by such issues as the reunification of families ... I hope that what we have each today committed ourselves to within Europe can apply also to those within our countries who want to go to start a new life outside Europe, whether in the Middle East or elsewhere.""
64.	None of the noble provisions of the Final Act have yet been applied to the Jewish national minority in the Soviet Union. For them the Helsinki agreement is still a piece of paper, and detente is still far over the horizon. I hope that the Soviet Union will live up to the spirit of this historic agreement and will enable the Jews who aspire to be reunited with their brethren in their ancient homeland to do so without hindrance. For us this is the touchstone.
65.	Finally, in addressing the General Assembly I cannot ignore a grave development which affects the Jewish people wherever they may be. This is the mounting of a despicable attack on Zionism by associating it with abhorrent political concepts.
66.	Let me state categorically that anti-Zionism is but a euphemism for anti-Semitism. Subscribing to a resolution condemning Zionism means an endorsement of anti-Semitism and the legitimization of aggression against Israel. Let me state with equal emphasis that, on this the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of the survivors of the gas chambers and the concentration camps, the Jewish people will not tolerate a revival of the cancer of anti-Semitism. One cannot
here escape a tragic reflection how many of the 6 million victims of the Nazis would be alive today if it had been given to the Zionist movement to create the State of Israel before that catastrophe?
67.	It is painful to me to see a group of nations, many of which were recently liberated from colonial rule, deriding one of the most noble liberation movements in this century a movement which not only gave an example of encouragement and determination to the peoples struggling for independence but also actively aided many of them during their period of preparation for independence and immediately thereafter.
68.	What is the essence of Zionism? Zionism, in a nutshell, is the modern expression of the ancient Jewish heritage. Zionism is the national liberation movement of a people exiled from its historic homeland and dispersed among the nations of the world. Zionism is the redemption of an ancient nation from a tragic lot and the redemption of a land neglected for centuries. Zionism is the revival of an ancient language and culture, in which the vision of universal peace has been a central theme. Zionism is the embodiment of a unique pioneering spirit, of the dignity of labor and of enduring human values. Zionism means creating a society, however imperfect it may still be, which tries to implement the highest ideals of democracy political, social and cultural for all the inhabitants of Israel, irrespective of religious belief, race or sex. Zionism is, in sum, the constant and unrelenting effort to realize the national and universal vision of the prophets of Israel.

4,1981,"ISR_prev_1998","150.	At the outset, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Vanuatu and Belize on their independence and welcome them on their admission to the United Nations. On behalf of the Government and the people of Israel, I wish them success and prosperity as independent and sovereign States.
151.	The Government and the people of Israel have always upheld the ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. It could not have been otherwise, for Israel's intellectual and moral traditions have given birth to some of the most important elements inherent in the shape and meaning of the Organization. The brotherhood of man, social justice, the rule of law both domestic and international the equality of nations, the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the outlawing of war those and other ideals had grown and taken root among the shepherds and peasants of Judea and Israel long before they came to be accepted as principles of current international life.
152.	Unfortunately, these ideals have been honored more in the breach than in the observance in the practice of the United Nations. In recent years the Organization has repeatedly permitted itself to be abused by Israel's adversaries who enjoy a built-in majority in the Assembly on any issue related to the ArabIsraeli conflict. In recent years Israel has more than once been the victim of discriminatory treatment in the United Nations.
153.	It must be stressed that international organizations which allow their fundamental rules to be violated cause severe damage to themselves and thereby undermine their very raison d'etre. Decisions arrived at in disregard of the relevant provisions of constitutional instruments are illegal, however often repeated and however overwhelming the majority that supported them.
154.	The distortions which pervade the United Nations system have also manifested themselves in the attitude of the Organization towards the Camp David accords and the treaty of peace between Egypt and Israel. By any yardstick, the conclusion of peace between two former enemies is surely not only a legitimate but also a desirable development which should have been welcomed by the United Nations, the primary purpose of which is the promotion and maintenance of international peace. No third party, including the Assembly, has the legal or moral authority to question, let alone to deny, the validity of the accords attained or of any treaties deriving from them,
155.	A major issue that has rightly engaged the attention and growing concern of all mankind is that of international cooperation for development and the widening gap between the standard of living of the poor nations and that of the wealthy nations. However, the NorthSouth dialog has remained largely a debate among nations and groups of nations, and, as might be expected, those suffering hunger and deprivation have not had their lot improved by this debate.
156.	For the last 20 years Israel has been involved in the effort to develop ways and means of raising the standard of living in the less developed societies. It is our wish and we believe that it is within our capacity to make a further contribution of our own to joint efforts to tackle specific development problems and advance towards a solution.
157.	Ever since its establishment Israel has had to cope simultaneously with a wide range of grave social, economic and security problems. We have absorbed and integrated hundreds of thousands of immigrants many of them victims of persecution in the Arab countries from which they had come and at the same time set about creating a progressive and rapidly developing society. With all the urgent problems that weighed upon us, we have spared no effort in cooperating with other young developing nations in such fields as agriculture, hydrology, rural development, health and youth leadership. This fruitful process of international cooperation with dozens of countries, regardless of political outlook, has been constantly moving forward.
158.	In their continuous search for solutions to the evolving challenges of development, Israel's experts have recently formulated some new ideas on development, referred to by them as the Transitional Economy Plan. It is a model for empirical dynamic development, well within the means of the countries concerned. I wish to take this opportunity to invite the attention of the General Assembly to document A/36/497, circulated at the request of my delegation, which contains a report entitled ""An Outline of Development through Promotion of the Transitional Economy"". We do not claim that this plan is a panacea for all the world's economic ills. Rather, it aims at applying a gradual, step-by-step, relatively low-cost program of improvements to the rural sector of society, a sector that so far has not been given sufficient attention. We will be happy to cooperate with any national or international organization for the purpose of putting the concepts contained in this plan into practice.
159.	At the thirty-fifth session [15th meeting], we appealed from this rostrum to the Soviet Government to remove all the limitations and obstacles hindering Jews in the Soviet Union from leaving for Israel. Already at that time there were grounds for fearing that the Soviet Union was going to close its gates to those Jews. Unfortunately, those fears have since been substantiated. Over the past year we have been watching with growing anxiety the steady decrease in the number of Jews leaving the Soviet Union to the lowest number for the last 10 years. The Soviet Union is thus forcibly preventing many thousands of them from living in their homeland.
160.	In parallel, we have witnessed again a regrettable increase in the violation of fundamental human rights in the Soviet Union. Over the past six months the number of prisoners of Zion detained under false pretexts and sentenced by Soviet courts to long prison terms has doubled. The sole crime of these people is their desire to live as Jews in their own land. Ida Nudel, Victor Brailovski, Anatoly Shcharansky and others have been gaoled for that desire, while others who have been refused exit permits have been subjected to pressure to refrain from so-called antiSoviet activity. The Assembly should know that the antiSoviet activity in question consists of the study of the Hebrew language and of the reading of books on Jewish history and Judaism.
161.	From this rostrum I wish to appeal once again to the Soviet Union to reopen its gates for Jews who wish to return to their homeland and to cease the persecution of the Jews in the Soviet Union.
162.. There are also other countries in which Jews have been subjected to discrimination and oppression. In particular, 1 must again express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds hostage and which it prevents from leaving.
163.	Permit me to turn now to the subject of the nuclear menace posed by Iraq. The item on the agenda of the Assembly dealing with the destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor has been formulated in a manner clearly intended to prejudge the outcome of the debate. As has been stated by Israel, the decision to destroy that reactor was taken only when it became absolutely certain that Iraq was on the verge of producing nuclear bombs, the principal target of which would have been Israel. People in all parts of the world, including the Middle East, are sleeping more soundly today, secure in the knowledge that that particular reactor has been removed. Iraq's nuclear reactor had to be destroyed before it became operational in the summer of 1981, for its destruction at a later date would have brought about radioactive fallout, endangering the civilian population of Baghdad.
164.	Ever since the establishment of the State of Israel, Iraq has been conspiring against it, both politically and militarily. Iraq set out to acquire nuclear facilities and expertise and then proceeded to assemble all the ingredients required for the development of nuclear weapons. This indicated a calculated effort on the part of Iraq to embark on a nuclear weapons program, Our concern about the Iraqi nuclear program was shared also by authoritative foreign governmental and professional assessments. None the less, six years of diplomatic and public efforts to bring about the cessation of the Iraqi military nuclear program yielded little more than reference to IAEA inspections under the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iraq is a signatory. Israel has had to conclude that a country which acquired a complete fuel cycle and is openly bent on the destruction of Israel will not balk at going ahead with its program, whether or not it is a party to the NonProliferation Treaty.
165.	Let me take this opportunity to reiterate Israel's policy that it will not be the first country in the Middle East to introduce nuclear weapons into the region. Faced as it is with the stark realities of the Middle East, Israel must insist on distinguishing between spurious and genuine safety. As the case of Iraq has clearly demonstrated, the NonProliferation Treaty cannot effectively prevent such a country from resorting to nuclear weapons so as to achieve what more conventional means have failed to do.
166.	The only genuine way to remove the nuclear threat to the Middle East can be found in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, freely and directly negotiated among the countries of the region and based on mutual assurances, on the pattern of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. In the Assembly we shall continue to advocate and support constructive steps genuinely advancing the prospect of a Middle East free of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we shall warn against, and oppose, steps designed to exploit this subject as a tool of antiIsrael political warfare.
167.	The situation in Lebanon has been a source of grave concern in our region for a number of years. That country has been subjected to strife and bloodshed from the mid-1970's onwards, due to the exploitation by Syria and by the PLO of domestic rivalries in Lebanon, followed by outright invasion of the country by the Syrian army. The situation has been worsened by the tightening of the PLO's grip on large parts of the country. Furthermore, in order to promote their regional strategic aims, the Syrians have subjected the Lebanese civilian population to brutal attacks which have brought about the destruction of a large portion of the country. Some 120,000 Lebanese civilians have been the victims of Syrian and PLO atrocities. It is characteristic of the double standard practiced in international relations that these atrocities have never been condemned by the international community, including the United Nations. Arab and Soviet bloc supporters of Syria and the PLO have made any such condemnation impossible.
168.	It is our hope that an independent and free Lebanon will soon reemerge and maintain good relations with all its neighbors, including Israel. But this will be very difficult to achieve as long as the PLO is allowed to nest in Lebanon and to hatch schemes aimed at promoting international terrorism and the mounting of brutal and cowardly attacks against the civilian population of Israel, especially in the northern part of our country. There will be no end to the tragedy of Lebanon as long as the Syrian occupation continues and as long as the PLO maintains its terrorist bases in Lebanon, supported by armaments from foreign Powers, mainly the Soviet Union and Libya. The Government of Israel will at all times support the reestablishment of a truly independent Lebanon, within its internationally recognized boundaries, free of Syrian occupation and PLO terror.
169.	The main cause of the ArabIsrael conflict has always been the refusal of Arab States to accept the existence of an independent and secure State of Israel and their avowed commitment to its destruction. The events of the last four years have brought about a major breakthrough in that respect: after Egypt abandoned the path of war and announced its readiness to negotiate peace, peace inevitably followed. Furthermore, while the winds of war have been constantly blowing in other parts of the region, Egypt and Israel, which not long ago were faced with the imminent danger of war, are now learning to coexist in peace and represent an island of stability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, this is not yet the case with regard to the other Arab neighbors of Israel. These Arab States, which have been invited by the signatories of the Camp David framework for peace to join the peace process, have so far refused to do so.
170.	One of the clearest manifestations of their categorical opposition to the peace process is their continuing and unprecedented military buildup through arms purchases from the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc nations, as well as from the United States and Western Europe. Since 1978 the major Arab countries, excluding Egypt, have concluded arms deals valued at $27.8 billion, of which $11.6 billion worth has already been delivered.
171.	These acquisitions of arms reflect a formidable quantitative and qualitative military buildup in those countries. These arms are unfortunately intended primarily for use against Israel. Needless to say, the stepped-up arming of the Arab States serves to strengthen their conviction that the ArabIsrael conflict can still be solved by military means. Moreover, it jeopardizes the internal stability of several of the Arab regimes, as well as of the region as a whole.
172.	The Camp David accords have been and remain the only feasible path to peace; no other viable solution appears on the horizon. Just last week we resumed the negotiations with Egypt, with the participation of the
United States, on the establishment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district. We hope to bring these negotiations before long to a successful conclusion.
173.	Our people were not handed their State on a silver platter. We fought for liberation against a colonial Power. We then had to fight against a host of Arab armies that sought to prevent the establishment of our State. Subsequently, we have fought four more wars to defend it. We know very well the meaning and the price of combating colonialism, of a struggle for liberation and of fighting for self-determination.
174.	These concepts are now being abused and exploited by a number of Arab Governments in the name of the Palestinian Arabs. The Palestinian Arabs do have a State on a major part of the territory of Palestine. In Jordan, there exists a Palestinian Arab State in everything but name. It is a Palestinian Arab State by virtue of its geography, demography, history, culture, religion and language. It has even been declared as such by an impressive number of Palestinian Arab and Jordanian leaders, There is thus no need to speak further of Palestinian self-determination; their homeland is already in existence. Moreover, in 1964, when the PLO approved the so-called Palestinian National Covenant with a view to ""liberating"" Palestine, at a time when Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district were still under Jordanian and Egyptian occupation, the real goal of the Arab States was to ""liberate"" Israel from Israelis, to deprive Israel of its existence. That aim is still fervently pursued today under the cover of the slogan of a ""homeland for the homeless Palestinians"", which is given immense publicity by Arab propagandists and their supporters.
175.	Israel firmly believes in a vision of peace for our region and will strive towards its realization. The Middle East is rich, not only in history and in spiritual and cultural assets, but also in immense natural resources and manpower. The people of Israel has as much to offer for the development and progress of our region as have the other neighboring peoples, each in its own way.
176.	The Jewish people has reestablished its home in the land of its forefathers, where the Kingdoms of Judea and Israel flourished for centuries. We have now restored our sovereignty over this area after 19 centuries of homelessness, with Jerusalem, which has always been the center and sole focus of the national and spiritual life of the Jewish people, as the undivided and indivisible capital of Israel
177.	We have returned to the land of Israel and have come there to stay. Together all the nations of the Middle East can usher in an era of real peace and cooperation in the region. The opportunity is there. Let us not miss it."
4,1982,"ISR_prev_1998","May I join the representatives who have preceded 
me in this debate in offering to the President 
their congratulations on his unanimous election 
to the high office of President and to you, Sir, 
to that of Vice-President of the thirty-seventh 
session of the General Assembly. My delegation 
trusts that the President will guide this session 
with fairness and wisdom. I have noted with great 
interest the contents of his thoughtful statement 
at the opening of this session, and especially 
his cogent reference to:  the inclusion in the 
agenda of items on so-called crisis situations 
that produced nothing but sterile debate and 
diverted attention from the real crises 
threatening the world with an escalation of the 
conflict .
58.	The annual general debates at the General 
Assembly provide an occasion for surveying the 
state of the world, the working of the 
international system during the preceding year 
and for a public airing of the hopes and 
concerns, the expectations and anxieties of our 
nations. Such a survey will show that the 
prospects for a better life and for peace for 
the peoples of the world have hardly been 
advanced this past year, while new difficulties 
have been added to the old unresolved problems.
59.	Major international problems of an 
economic, social and military nature have also 
grown at a rapid rate, and the international 
system has not been able to cope with them. Many 
essential problems have not reached the United 
Nations agenda at all. With regard to others with 
which the United Nations did engage itself, its 
contribution has been far from encouraging. Thus, 
universal disappointment has been caused this 
year by the failure of the special session on 
disarmament and the stalemate in the North-South 
dialogue.
60.	The world scene is constantly threatened 
by simmering conflicts, some of which remain 
dormant for the time being while others are on 
the verge of eruption, their solutions eluding 
international statesmanship.
61.	In Afghanistan, the aggressive invasion, 
occupation and strife continue unabated. A 
permanent member of the Security Council 
continues to ignore numerous United Nations 
resolutions.
62.	In both the Horn of Africa and Western 
Sahara conflicts persist, and the seeds of future 
violence and bloodshed are being sown with no 
success achieved through international efforts to 
defuse those potential volcanoes.
63.	Kampuchea remains occupied by Vietnamese 
troops who have disregarded calls for a 
withdrawal by the United Nations, ASEAN and other 
bodies.
64.	Only recently we witnessed the violent 
eruption of the old conflict over the Falkland 
Islands (Malvinas). Although the United Nations 
has been involved for years in the question of 
the sovereignty over those islands, it was unable 
to prevent war or to stop it.
65.	In our region instability is endemic. It 
arises from a variety of causes, which must be 
recognized for what they are. In most countries 
great poverty exists alongside the immense wealth 
of some of the oil- producing States. Some 
Governments are alarmed at the rise of fanatical 
fundamentalist movements. Most countries are 
governed by regimes that retain absolute power in 
their hands, and any expression of criticism or 
opposition is ruthlessly suppressed. Talk of Arab 
solidarity and unity often conceals or is refuted 
by a reality of constant strife, tension and 
friction between neighbouring States.
66.	The Moody and senseless war between Iraq 
and Iran rages on. It has already exacted many 
thousands of casualties and consumed several 
scores of billions of dollars which could well 
have been utilized for development and social 
progress.
67.	Lebanon is beginning to emerge from a 
seven- year-old conflict in which the Lebanese 
were occupied and ravaged by their Syrian 
neighbors and their unwelcome guests, the 
terrorists of the PLO.
68.	I do not mention these conflicts and the 
chronic instability which produces them in a 
spirit of criticism or denigration. They are part 
of the reality with which everyone concerned with 
durable peace and security in the Middle East has 
to contend. No magic formula can change this 
situation or solve the problems that created it.
69.	Nevertheless, there are those who 
suggest, whether out of naivety, ignorance or ill 
intent, that a solution to the Arab-Israeli 
dispute would bring peace and stability 
throughout the Middle East region. The recent 
events in Lebanon alone demonstrate the fallacy 
of this suggestion. Some Arab Governments could 
not resist the temptation to utilize the services 
of terrorist organizations to settle their scores 
with other Governments. A small defenseless 
State, Lebanon, with a weak Government, became an 
ideal battleground for this purpose. This was 
compounded by Syria's designs on Lebanon's 
independence and integrity. The resultant 
explosion had little or no connection with the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. The same applies to the 
Iraq-Iran conflict, the tension between Jordan 
and Syria and the endless disputes between Libya 
and the rest of the Arab world.
70.	It is frequently claimed that the fault 
lies, not in the United Nations system, but in 
its Members, that the Organization merely 
reflects their failings. This is of course true, 
but it is equally true that a system which 
encourages contention rather than compromise, 
boycott rather than co-operation, confrontation 
rather than negotiation, hardly meets the needs 
of a world as diverse as ours in race, religion, 
culture and social and political practice.
71.	Particularly and unnecessarily disruptive 
is the undue politicization of the United Nations 
specialized agencies. Instead of devoting 
themselves to the social, humanitarian, 
scientific and technical tasks which they were 
set up to perform and which most of them perform 
well when allowed to do so, these agencies are 
only too frequently subverted and misused for 
partisan interests. Can it be doubted that this 
is one of the causes for the failure of the 
United Nations system to contribute effectively 
towards halting the crises and deterioration in 
the world economy?
72.	I feel that it is appropriate for me at 
this juncture to pay a tribute to the 
Secretary-General, who has provided us with much 
food for thought in his provocative and 
imaginative report on the work of the 
Organization. I represent a country which most 
certainly can be said to be reluctant  to resort 
to the Security Council or to use the machinery 
of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has 
cogently set out the reasons. I can assure him 
that the Government of Israel will support 
constructive and effective measures advancing the 
prospect of a world in whichóto use his 
languageóthe small and weak have reliable defense 
and shelter. At the same time, we shall warn 
against and oppose steps designed to exploit and 
abuse the Secretary-General thoughtful proposals 
as one more tool of political warfare.
73.	The principles, upon which the United 
Nations was founded, as well as the Charter, 
should have moved the Organization and its 
Membersóas far back as 30 years agoóto take a 
stand against the denial on the part of the Arab 
world of the right of a Member State, Israel, to 
exist in security. When the United Nations 
ignored this inalienable obligation, it did so at 
its peril, undermining its own credibility and 
moral power. Since then, the United Nations has 
lacked the courage to rise and condemn any act of 
aggression, threat, violence, blackmail and 
terror, both direct and indirect, towards Israel 
by the Arab States and their accomplices.
74.	The Assembly has even chosen to reject 
the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egyptian 
peace treaty and has ignored the completion 
earlier this year of Israel's withdrawal from 
Sinai. It has devoted much time to other, 
apparently more congenial, aspects of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict.
75.	Among the thousands of resolutions 
adopted by the General Assembly and the Security 
Council or any other United Nations body during 
the past 30 years, one will find hardly a single 
decision or resolution that explicitly condemns 
by name any Arab State or organization for 
attacks on Israel or Israelis. During these 30 
years, have Arabs never practiced military 
attacks, terrorist actions, hijacking airplanes, 
taking hostages, not to speak of the placing of 
embargoes and blockades and any similar hostile 
act which international law would even define as 
a casus belli the Arab States and their terror 
organizations always appear to be innocent and 
injured; offended but never offending.
76.	United Nations documentation is replete 
with anti-Israel resolutions, which have 
increased yearly in both number and length, 
overflowing with distorted suppositions, 
arbitrary statements and one-sided and 
destructive recommendations and decisions. Even 
the discussion of the establishment of a nuclear- 
weapon-free zone in the Middle East did not 
escape the bane of politicization and 
partisanship. The consensus attained on this 
issue in the Assembly in 1980 was wrecked last 
year. We hope that it can be restored, and we 
stand by our statements made here in the past. 
None of the many differences between the States 
of the Middle East should be permitted to stand 
in the way of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This we 
owe to our children and their common future. The 
Government of Israel stands ready to begin 
negotiations to this end with all Middle Eastern 
States at once, anywhere and without 
pre-conditions.
77.	Double standards and distortion have 
spread from General Assembly and committee 
discussions to other United Nations bodies, 
including the Security Council, and from there to 
the directives given to the United Nations forces 
and instrumentalities in the Middle East. A 
notable case is the misuse of UNRWA. That Agency 
was charged with the rehabilitation of refugees 
but became a tool to preserve the refugee camps, 
in which idle people were subjected to 
incitement and coercion in the service of 
terrorist organizations.
78.	The specialized agencies, such as WHO, 
ILO and so on have also been exploited for the 
purpose of propaganda warfare against Israel, 
overstepping their areas of responsibility and 
competence. Last week at the General Conference 
of IAEA great damage was done to the integrity of 
that Agency and the whole United Nations system 
when the credentials of the delegation of Israel 
were rejected in a blatant exercise of political 
abuse and discrimination.
79.	The accumulated effect of these 
distortions and shortcomings could be clearly 
seen in Lebanon. There developed a threat to 
Israel, as well as to the welfare and 
independence of Lebanon, a base for international 
terror and a large heavily armed force which was 
being put into action in constantly escalating 
attacks on the villages and towns of northern 
Israel.
80.	Benefiting from the respectability and 
prestige bestowed by United Nations resolutions, 
the PLO entrenched itself in Lebanon and set up a 
pirate State within a State, forcing a regime of 
terror on the Palestinians and Lebanese. The 
PLO's terrorist bases, designed for attacks on 
Israel and to serve international terror, 
operated and grew unhindered within camps marked 
by UNRWA signs and enjoying welfare payments 
contributed for humanitarian purposes. Behind the 
backs of the United Nations peace-keeping forces 
in southern Lebanon the terrorists built a 
military infrastructure and huge arms stores, in 
preparation for a combined Arab assault against 
Israel from the north and the east.
81.	Had we allowed United Nations 
resolutions, as distinct from the Charter, to 
determine what might or might not be done in 
Arab-Israeli relations, our future would have 
been destruction. Those resolutions allowed Arab 
countries to pursue their belligerence against 
Israelómilitary, political, economic and so 
forthóand the PLO could continue its terror 
warfare against Israel, Israelis and Jews, 
without any restriction by the United Nations. 
The enemies of Israel felt that they could embark 
on a full-scale military attack whenever they 
judged the hour to be right, knowing full wel 
that the United Nations would not move a finger 
to stop them.
82.	It is sufficient to recall United Nations 
behavior in 1967, when discussion in the Security 
Council of the warlike steps Egypt had carried 
out in May and June 1967 was prevented. It is 
enough to be reminded of the apathy with which 
the United Nations reacted when Egypt and Syria 
broke the cease-fire and launched a co-ordinate 
surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur 1973.
83.	Even the information at our disposal 
before the Peace for Galilee operation in early 
June did not foresee all that we found in the 
terrorists' bases, headquarters, arms and 
ammunition reservoirs, operational documents and 
so forth. We received concrete proof of planned, 
large-scale aggression which was to have taken 
place in the near future.
84.	Lebanese and also Palestinians who for 
years suffered from PLO terror and feared to 
divulge what had happened to them are now free to 
unmask the true face of the PLO in action. They 
corroborate our gravest suspicions.
85.	The entire international community has 
the responsibility and should have the courage to 
stand up and formally ban PLO terrorism and expel 
its representatives from every self-respecting 
State and every international body. The United 
Nations and its agencies cannot begin the process 
of rehabilitation and revitalization as long as 
such organizations and their representatives are 
permitted to set foot in a civilized forum.
86.	Thirty-seven years ago, with the defeat 
of nazism, we all believed that the civilized 
world had learned the lesson of anti-Semitism 
that led to its most terrible 
expressionógenocide. Unfortunately, this monster 
is raising its ugly head once again. Often, 
attacks on Israel or Zionism in international 
forums serve as a transparent mask for 
anti-Semitism. The State of Israel, which is the 
fulfillment of the Jewish national movement, 
cannot and will not passively accept a resurgence 
of this evil ideology. We call on all self- 
respecting people and Governments to join in a 
renewed solemn undertaking to stamp out 
anti-Semitism, in all its forms and expressions, 
from human society.
87.	It is a stain on our civilization and on 
the Governments directly concerned that Jewish 
communities in the Soviet Union and in Syria 
remain deprived of their human rights, especially 
the basic right to leave and take up residence in 
countries of their choice. The State of Israel, 
national homeland of the Jewish people, cannot 
and will not rest until these rights are granted.
88.	Just four years ago the leaders of Egypt, 
Israel and the United States concluded an 
historic agreement at Camp David. Egypt assumed 
the role of pioneer among Arab States. The two 
neighbors accepted each other's right to exist 
behind secure and recognized borders. The 
negotiations were long and arduous. Israel's 
sacrifices and the risks it undertook in the 
implementation of the Camp David accords were 
heavy. A framework for general peace was 
pains-takingly devised. Egypt, Israel and the 
United States repeatedly countered criticism of 
the Camp David accords, emphasizing that these 
accords were the only agreed, and therefore the 
only viable, path to peace between Israel and its 
neighbors.
89.	Our approach is practical and realistic. 
We are ready to renew negotiations toward the 
establishment of the self-governing authority for 
the Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and Gaza 
District, as provided for in the autonomy plan. 
The representatives who will be elected to the 
administrative council will be empowered to speak 
for the population and negotiate on the future 
status. There is a great deal of logic in the 
provisions specified in the Camp David agreement 
that the final status of these areas should not 
be negotiated at the present stage. We remain 
convinced that to focus now on what is beyond the 
horizon is a sure way of inviting failure.
90.	Israel would welcome additional partners 
to the process, as provided for in the Camp David 
accords. We firmly believe that agreement is 
achievable. There is no need to introduce new 
concepts and approaches which were discarded or 
not accepted at Camp David. We are not prepared, 
for instance, to reopen the debate on issues, 
such as the creation of a second Palestinian Arab 
State, which were rejected at Camp David in favor 
of more realistic and acceptable solutions.
91.	As for the refugee status in which many 
Palestinian Arabs have been kept over all the 
years since 1948, this is shameful testimony to 
the cynical exploitation of human suffering for 
political ends by Arab Governments. The number of 
Palestinian Arab refugees in 1948 was about 
350,000. There is no lack of land or financial 
resources in Arab lands, including Palestinian 
territory in Trans-Jordan, to provide them with 
homes and employment. Israel did as much and even 
more, with meager resources, for some 800,000 
Jews who left or fled from Arab and Moslem lands 
after 1948. The humanitarian aspect of this 
problem could have been solved several times over 
in the intervening years.
92.	In addition to creating a Palestine 
problem and using it as a weapon against Israel, 
Arab Governments instituted a boycott against 
Israel in almost every sphere of human endeavor 
and supported the terrorist organizations' 
attacks on Israel. Against this background of 
active and sustained belligerency, it is 
ludicrous to search for moderation in possible 
hints contained in Arab summit resolutions, 
including the recent one at Fez. Any change 
toward moderation must first be reflected in 
deeds and facts.
93.	The Arab leaders responsible for this 
campaign against Israel have inflicted much 
suffering on the Palestinian Arabs without 
bringing them any closer to a solution of their 
problems. History will record the fact that 
Israel did more for the Palestinian Arabs and 
their welfare than their Arab brethren.
94.	Israel remains faithful to its commitment 
under the Camp David accords. Israel has 
cautioned against attempts to reinterpret, 
renegotiate or bypass them. These accords are the 
only accepted blueprint for the implementation of 
Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 
(1973). Pressing Israel for more territorial 
withdrawals will not bring peace. Indeed, there 
is no peace without security, and further 
territorial amputations negate security. Those of 
Israel's neighbors who seek peace and coexistence 
will find Israel a willing partner. But those who 
think that they can weaken Israel while dangling 
the word  peace  as a bait are deluding 
themselves. The reward for peace is peace itself. 
There can be no greater recompense in such a 
vital and noble cause.
95.	The foul massacre of civilians in the 
camps at Beirut brought a wave of shock, outrage 
and revulsion in Israel. The perpetrators of this 
crime are well known. They were not Israeli. 
Nevertheless, there were manifestations of blind 
hatred and false accusations leveled at Israel 
from a number of quarters. Such actions are 
outrageous and deserve universal condemnation.
96.	AH those who proceed along this path must 
realize that by such action they are weakening 
the chances of peace and encouraging those 
elements in the Middle East whose interests are 
served by radicalization and violence. The Middle 
East is sorely in need of good counsel, 
moderation, much patience and a sincere desire 
for coexistence of diverse ideas, ideologies, 
faiths and communities. Israel, for its part, is 
ready to participate in and contribute to the 
creation of such a reality and atmosphere in the 
Middle East."
4,1970,"ISR_prev_1998","93.	: Mr. President, your country, Norway, has a warm place in Israel's heart. Our common sacrifice drew our peoples together in the darkness of the Nazi age, and friendship has lit up every road that we have trodden ever since. Your erudition and integrity enlarge the respect which your country's name evokes across the world. In carrying out your charge you have before you the recent example of your predecessor, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph, who graced henPresidency with charm, originality and deep international convictions.
94.	The twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly has been chosen as a commemorative occasion. What we need most is not a festive celebration but a lucid exercise in self-criticism. The United Nations has fallen on hard days. Its resonance is diminished and its flame is burning low. It exerts no more than a marginal influence on the main issues of conflict in our times, and the central currents of international thought and action flow outside its walls. There is a sharp paradox in that turn of fortune, for there has never been a greater objective need for a unitary framework of international relations to express the common interest of mankind. For the first time in history distance has become irrelevant, and all peoples are bound together in danger and opportunity. Thus, international institutions seem to be declining in the very conditions which logically favor their success. The United Nations should be asking itself with implacable candor: ""what went wrong?"".
95.	The trouble lies, of course, mainly in the discordant policies of the States which compose international society. But this does not absolve the Organization from the duty to analyze its own experience and to take a rational and effective view of its priorities and procedures in the coming years. This Organization is young in relation to the immensity of the vision which it serves. Yet the rhythm of change has been so intense that the world in which the United Nations was born now belongs to receding memory. There is urgent need for Governments to determine the place which the United Nations occupies in their policies, and for the United Nations itself to modernize its concepts, structures, and its methods of operation. Only thus will the gap between the brilliant hope and the harsh reality be reduced.
96.	The main international preoccupation is now focused on the region where the Arab and Israeli nations were born and in which they must forever live side by side. In the summer of 1967 the Security Council and the General Assembly were the inactive spectators of a war that they did nothing to prevent. In recent weeks, they have watched a Member State in the Middle East pass through its most destructive and agonizing ordeal. It may be that in its present strength and condition our Organization is unable to restrain violence and ensure security as its Charter envisaged. But it need not renounce its role as the central forum from which the policies of its Members may be communicated to the opinion of the world. In that spirit I come to this rostrum to state Israel's views on the tensions which convulse our region and hang heavy on the conscience and concern of all mankind.
97.	The point of reference is still the unforgotten drama of 1967. Forty months have passed since a resolute attempt was made to bring about the destruction of Israel's peace, sovereignty and very life through the strangling grip of belligerency, blockade, encirclement and aggressive assault. Israel's policy is still dominated by the recollection of the brief moment when its extinction was a real and vivid prospect. The defeat of that attempt by its solitary effort and independent sacrifice is inscribed on Israel's unfailing memory. Beyond its place in Israel's history, that victory was a landmark in the human journey towards justice, law and peace. We still recall the relief and consolation which gripped the enlightened world when Israel tore the strangling fingers from its throat.
98.	Israel remembers. It cannot forget; it cannot forget the horror from which it barely escaped or the sense of salvation which came from its successful resistance. From then until now our national policy has been inspired by two central purposes: to build a structure of permanent peace with the neighboring States, if their policy makes that possible, and, in any case, to avoid a return to the conditions of anarchy and vulnerability out of which the war exploded.
99.	In its tense debates during 1967, the United Nations developed the contours of an international policy designed to meet the new conditions created by the 1967 war. It rejected all proposals for reproducing the situation which had led to one war and which, if renewed, would lead inevitably to another. It voted down five proposals for a return to the old armistice lines, and in November 1967 it called for the establishment of a just and lasting peace, based on the total renunciation of belligerency and war, the liquidation of maritime blockade and hostile acts, and the explicit recognition by the Arab States and Israel of each other's sovereignty, independence and national identity. It also called for the establishment of ""secure and recognized boundaries"". These have never existed in our region; they must be established by agreement for the first time.
100.	The simple theme of this international policy was that the structure of peace should be built by agreement between the States of the Middle East. An international representative, held in universal trust, was appointed to assist the parties in the promotion of that agreement. Moreover, a ceasefire had been proposed by the Security Council and accepted by the parties on the morrow of the war. According to its terms, the ceasefire was to be unconditional, of indefinite duration, and could not be legitimately set aside before the attainment of permanent peace.
101.	In its sessions since 1967 the General Assembly has reviewed successive attempts to bring about agreement on the establishment of a final peace Now and then a prospect has glowed briefly, only W be extinguished almost before it could be discerned. But by the summer of this year the perils were great enough to compel new thinking and new effort on many sides. In March 1969 President Nasser had unilaterally repudiated his country's agreement to maintain the ceasefire. The resultant warfare across the Suez Canal was henceforward constant, destructive and of growing intensity. And it was achieving no purpose whatever. Attempts to bring about Israel's collapse through attrition had totally failed. Israel was aware of the loss and waste inflicted on it and, still more, on Egypt by the war. But neither the artillery assaults on Israel's forces from the south, nor terrorist attacks on helpless civilians from the north and east, nor the arrogant violence and piracy of Arab terrorists in countries remote from the conflict had prevented our national enterprise from going forward in swift growth. Above all, the attacks by regular armies and terrorist groups had not dislodged us from any point along the ceasefire lines which we were resolved and internationally entitled to hold until the attainment of peace. The war of attrition brought its authors neither victory nor honor. Indeed, it exposed the Arab States to tensions, frustrations and dangers far greater than those by which Israel was afflicted.
102.	In this dilemma Arab policy faced two choices. It could acknowledge the futility of war, accept the reestablishment of the ceasefire and embark on the negotiation of a final peace; or it could appeal to forces outside the region for help to continue and intensify hostilities. The first choice would have meant to work with Israel for the establishment of peace; the second meant the pursuit of Soviet aid for maintaining the war at a higher level of intensity. Alas, it is clear that in the early months of 1970 the second choice was taken.
103.	Thereafter, the conflict was extended with every passing month beyond its regional context. It now took on a global dimension. A system of SAM2 missiles had been erected so that the artillery bombardment of Israeli forces could be carried out without fear of aerial response. The weapons were defensive only in the narrow tactical sense; they were geared to an offensive strategy, the elimination of the ceasefire and its replacement by a constant war of attrition. The missiles stand guard in order that the guns should be free to speak. When this strategy failed, through Israel's successful response, the more complex SAM3 missiles, this time manned by Soviet personnel, were introduced. And by early summer Soviet pilots were flying operational missions in the battle zone. Now, this was more ominous than anything that had gone on before. This aroused a worldwide concern. Nothing of the kind had happened anywhere since the end of the Second World War, apart from the unhappy participation of Soviet pilots in the bombardment of villages in Yemen in 1963. But Soviet involvement in the Suez Canal hostilities had far graver implications. It is bad enough that regional conflicts should rage unsolved through a rejection of the normal principles of ceasefire and negotiation. It is far worse when a great Power intervenes to aggravate a regional conflict, to widen its scope, to risk counteraction by other Powers and thus to extend the perils of a local war to all mankind. The Soviet intervention does not concern Israel alone. It has other aims. Its other aims are to win predominance in the Mediterranean; to outflank the European defense system from the south; to establish a large foreign army on African soil in contempt for the principle of African independence; and to bring about a general disturbance of the international equilibrium. Thus, President Nasser's repudiation of the ceasefire and the increasing scope of Soviet intervention have results which the world can ill afford.
104.	It was in the light of those conditions that my Government studied the United States peace initiative in June and July 1970. We knew that some Arab States and all the Palestine terrorist organizations had rejected that proposal because it spoke of peace, to which they are in principle totally opposed. We knew that Egypt and Jordan had accompanied their acceptance of the initiative by a statement of terms and conditions incompatible with its principles and with its authors' stated intentions. There were other features of the proposal which raised difficulties for us within our parliamentary and democratic system. But we saw this initiative with all its defects and complexities as an opportunity to explore the conditions of a final peace. These considerations prevailed above all the others. And so, on 4 August, the Government of Israel determined and formulated a policy to which it still adheres. We decided to designate a representative to discussions to be held under Ambassador Jarring's auspices with the United Arab Republic and Jordan.
105.	We stated that:
""Israel's position in favor of a ceasefire on the basis of reciprocity on all fronts, including the Egyptian front, in accordance with the Security Council's ceasefire resolutions remains unchanged. On the basis of clarifications given by the United States Government in this matter, Israel is prepared to reply affirmatively to the United States proposal for a ceasefire for at least three months on the Egyptian front.""
We further agreed:
""to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices within the framework of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of the expression of readiness by the parties to carry out the Security Council's resolution in all its parts, in order to achieve an agreed and binding contractual peace agreement which would ensure:
""(a) Termination by Egypt and Israel of all claims or states of belligerency and respect and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of each other and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threats or acts of force. Each of the parties to be responsible within its territory for the prevention of all hostile acts by regular military forces or paramilitary forces, including irregular forces, against the armed forces or against civilians living in the territory of the other party;
""(ft) Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the 1967 conflict to secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be determined in the peace agreements.""
That was the text to which we agreed.
106.	And, finally, we made clear that:
""Israel will not claim the prior acceptance by the other party of her positions, as Israel does not accept in advance the positions of the other parties as communicated publicly or otherwise. Each party will be free to present its proposals on the matters under discussion.""
107.	The ceasefire agreement, as members will see, held a central place in our response to the United States peace initiative. The United Arab Republic had limited its acceptance of the ceasefire to a period of ninety days. That restriction raised issues which would not have existed with comparable force in an unlimited ceasefire which would have brought the military phase of the conflict to a permanent end. Instead of this we now had an explicit prospect that after three months the United Arab Republic might regard the ceasefire as having expired. And the futile but destructive war of attrition would be resumed. Since that was the United Arab Republic position, its implications had to be seriously weighed. We had to ask ourselves whether the short negotiating period would be devoted to a genuine quest for peace; or whether it would be used as a respite for the United Arab Republic, with Soviet aid, to improve its prospect for a military solution by a massive missile concentration which would be brought up without Israeli interference under cover of the ceasefire. In short, what were the ninety days designed to promote: an EgyptianIsraeli effort at peace, or a SovietEgyptian deployment for a more effective war?
108.	Decisive reassurance on this question was found for us in that part of the American peace initiative which provided for a ""standstill"" in an agreed area on each side of the Suez Canal ceasefire line. The purpose was to stabilize the local military balance, so that our Governments could go forward in easy mind to negotiate, without fear lest their security would be undermined during the talks. And the standstill, more than any other part of the United States peace initiative, supported our cautious hope that the United Arab Republic might be ready for an authentic peace effort, and not merely for a maneuver designed to prepare a new phase of war.
109.	In the early days of August we were informed by the United States that the United Arab Republic, with the support of the Soviet Union, had given agreement and endorsement to the following pro visions. This is the text of the standstill agreement:
""(a) Israel and the United Arab Republic will observe a ceasefire effective at 2200 hours GMT Friday 7 August;
""(ft) Both sides will stop all incursions and all firing on the ground and in the air across the ceasefire lines;
""(c) Both sides will refrain from changing the military status quo within the zones extending 50 kilometers to the east and to the west of the ceasefire line. Neither side will introduce or construct any new military installations in these zones. Activities within the zones will be limited to the maintenance of existing installations at their present sites and positions'' the maintenance of existing (installations at their present sites and positions 4 'and to the rotation and supply of forces presently within the zones;
""(d) For the purpose of verifying observance of the ceasefire, each side will rely on its own national means, including reconnaissance aircraft which will be free to operate without interference up to 10 kilometers from the ceasefire line on its own side of the line;
""(e) Each side may avail itself as appropriate of all United Nations machinery in reporting alleged violations to each other of the ceasefire and of the military standstill;
""(0 Both sides will abide by the Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War and will accept the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross in carrying out their obligations under that Convention.""
110.	It was to this that we agreed. And I draw special attention to the phrases:
""Neither side will introduce or construct any new military installations in these zones. Activities within will be limited to the maintenance of existing installations at their present sites and positions.""
111.	Not a single hour passed between Egypt's acceptance of that agreement and its violation of it. Within a few days those violations had been physically ascertained not only by Israel, but by the Government which sponsored the peace initiative. At the very time when the Israeli Cabinet was hopefully formulating its approach to the forthcoming peace talks, the missile buildup became conspicuously massive and intense. It is going forward to this very day. In the ""standstill"" area, which is fifty kilometers west of the Canal, but mostly within an area thirty kilometer of the Canal, at least twenty- SAM2 and SAM3 batteries, many of them operational, have been introduced. Tens of additional missiles have been advanced into that zone. This has been made possible by Israel's observance of the ceasefire. Rarely has there been a more perfidious violation of an international agreement through the exploitation of the good faith and pacific intention of the other side. I have circulated to delegations this morning, a graphic representation comparing the position which should exist under the 7 August agreement with that existing a few days ago, a situation created by headlong violation.
112.	I now come to analyze the implications of this development.
113.	First, through Israel's acceptance of the ceasefire standstill agreement the United Arab Republic has achieved a substantial and illicit change of the military situation to its advantage.
114.	Secondly, in these conditions Israel would be negotiating under the intimidating effects of a growing threat to its forces along the ceasefire line, and therefore to its national security.
115.	Thirdly, there has been a collapse of confidence in the validity of Egypt's pledge. The proposed peace talks, after all, would be designed to produce an agreement, on the strength of which Israel would withdraw on the establishment of peace to secure, recognized and agreed boundaries which are not yet determined, but which would be determined in the peace negotiations. The object of the talks would be agreement. But what would be the worth or weight of a new agreement negotiated and concluded while an existing agreement is being torn cynically to shreds. Thus, the violation of the standstill agreement has cast an anticipatory shadow on the validity of any peace agreement that we hope to conclude. This is, in the last resort, the gravest result of all. The question, what binding force will a peace agreement have, overshadows every other question affecting the Middle East in future.
116.	Fourthly, the standstill agreement was not only accepted by the United Arab Republic; it was also endorsed by the Soviet Union, which, as I have said, mans many of the missile bases. Therefore, the violation of that agreement with Soviet acquiescence is a major international event. Its repercussions go far beyond the Middle East; they affect the crucial issues of peace and security in other continents of the world. They shed a disturbing light on Soviet policy everywhere. Member States in all continents would do well to take this to heart and mind.
117.	In making a firm stand for the integrity of agreements we defend an international interest wider than our own. It is still our desire and policy to explore the terms of a final peace by discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in accordance with our statement of 4 August. In a dialog on peace we shall have much to say and to propose for the common benefit of our region. I must add, in frankness, that even when the violations are corrected, the memory of them will not swiftly vanish from our minds and hearts. A new burden has been laid on the eventual negotiating process which, at best, will be complex, arduous and long. When we reflect on our experience with the hopes and expectations of 1957 and with this latest incident, we become fortified in our resolve to insist that all peace engagements be direct, explicit, signed and sealed in the most precise contractual form. Israel is ready to resume discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices as soon as the violations are rectified and the situation prevailing on the day of the ceasefire restored.
118.	The Egyptian violation of the ceasefire agreement is only one of the obstacles which now impede progress towards peace. Others have come into sharp relief during the hectic events of the past few days. The Palestinian Arabs on both sides of the Jordan are in urgent need of peace. They have been the primary victims of the hostile policies whereby neighboring Arab States have for twenty-two years sought to prevent the establishment of peaceful and constructive relations between Israel and the Arab States. Palestinian Arabs, west of the river Jordan, are at this very time creating new processes of coexistence and commerce between themselves and the Israeli people. Their situation in recent days has been in sharp contrast with the immense havoc which came upon their kinsmen east of the Jordan in the recent fighting. No constructive interests of Palestinian Arabs can be served by the small gangs commanded by Arafat, Habash and others whose ideology consists of nothing except the prevention of peace between Israel and the Arab States. As we watched the torrents of shells, grenades and bullets pouring from and into streets and homes across the river Jordan last week, we could not fail to reflect what the fate of every Israeli home would be if our nation's security were not maintained and defended with the utmost tenacity and zeal.
119.	Let us have a frank understanding of what every one of the Palestine terrorist organizations portends. There is no distinction between the means they use and the aims they seek. The means and the aims are equally to be condemned. What is the aim? The aim is to fulfill an exclusive fantasy under which Israel would have no existence in the Middle East as a State embodying its specific Jewish heritage and its particular national and social vocation. Their doctrine is based on the wild absurdity that there can ever be a Middle East without a State of Israel at its heart and centre. They turn away in flight from the central truth that Israel is organic to the past, the present and the future of the Middle East. The Arab nation has a very large place in the Middle Eastern region, but it has no monopoly on the right to statehood, independence, sovereignty and specific national identity. The Middle East is a concept which cannot be exhaustively understood in Arab terms alone. In 1970 Israel's statehood is not something to be explained, defended, or submitted to approval or dissent. It is something to be proclaimed as an absolute and inexorable reality, deep rooted and authentic, on a level of absolute equality with the statehood, sovereignty and national identity of any nation, great or small, old or young, represented in this hall. We do not seek what is called ""recognition of Israel's right to exist"", for that right is independent of any recognition of it. What we seek is a reciprocal recognition by the Arab States and Israel of each other's right to peaceful life and unreserved sovereignty. In denying this axiomatic right, the terrorist organizations commit the most disruptive heresy at work in the life of our age. There are now fourteen Arab sovereign States, with a population of a hundred million, an area of four million square miles, and unlimited wealth and opportunity. Facing them alone in the scales of equity is the small State of Israel. There is, therefore, only one nation which stands or fails in history by the way in which this conflict is resolved. By its solitude and uniqueness, Israel's secure existence is the overriding moral imperative in this dispute. International peace demands an equitable distribution not only of wealth and material resources but also of sovereignty and national freedom. To suggest a distribution whereby all Arabs must be sovereign everywhere and all Jews nowhere is to fall into an abyss of paradox and discrimination.
120.	So much for the aims of the terrorist groups. The aim is politicize the murder of a state and the method is piracy and murder. The moral quality of the struggle is illustrated by assaults on housewives in a supermarket, on students in a cafeteria, on humble citizens, Jews and Arabs, in crowded markets and bus stations, on innocent travelers in vulnerable civil aircraft. No other political movement in our days has chosen its victims so exclusively amongst defenseless, unarmed civilians in many lands. Therefore, it is a movement not of liberation but of enslavement. Its aim is not to win freedom for the Arab nation, whose freedom is amply and lavishly assured, but to liquidate the national liberation which another nation, the most ancient of nations, has already achieved. Such honourable words as ""liberation"", ""resistance"" and ""commando"" have no application and have never before been applied to attempts to liquidate a lawful sovereignty, to compound the Nazi assault on Jewish survival and to wage a campaign of indiscriminate attack against civilians in the Middle East and elsewhere.
121.	Having failed in their assaults on Israel, the Fatah organization, the ""Palestine Liberation Organization"" and other kindred groups have directed their main threat against the independence and sovereignty of Arab States. Early this year they were hard at work attempting to turn Lebanon away from its peaceful vocation and to subvert its specific national personality. Last week we saw the most recent of many attempts to bring about anarchy and disintegration in Jordan in order to shatter any hope of peace between Israel and the Arabs nations.
122.	Arab Governments which are the victims of these acts are, ironically, often the sponsors of them. The terrorist groups do not spring out of the empty air. They do not work in a vacuum. They could not exist, still less function, without the shelter, support, endorsement, financial aid, arms, training facilities and territorial base supplied to them by sovereign Arab States. Nor could they endanger life and limb outside the Middle East if certain Governments, especially in Europe, did not grant them excessive indulgence and immunity. Surely the time has come for the world community to turn in wrath not only against the specific outrage of aerial piracy but also against the other activities of the terrorist groups. All these activities, without exception, violate the principles which the signatories of the Charter, including its Arab signatories, have pledged themselves to defend. Any action which aims to destroy or violate a legitimate sovereignty is a form of international hijacking. Therefore it is important that these acts be resisted. They were successfully resisted ten days ago by those who foiled the hijacking of an El A1 aircraft by using righteous force against an odious pair of pirates. They were resisted by Jordan, which but for that resistance would have lost title to be regarded as a sovereign authority. The main adversaries of peace suffered another setback when the invasion of Jordan by regular armored units of the Syrian 
Army was repelled. The Syrian invasion of Jordan was too brief for its full implications to be seized. Here we have a member of the Security Council violating an international frontier in order to impose its will and policy upon a neighboring State. A Syrian representative at the United Nations, attempting publicly to justify this aggression, has taken refuge in a doctrine which denies the international character of boundaries between States of kindred cultures.
123.	The General Assembly will recall that after the Soviet aggression against Czechoslovakia two years ago Soviet representatives asserted that the boundaries between socialist States did not have a full international character, so that the unprovoked invasion of territory across them had a kind of domestic intimacy. Something of that kind was asserted by Syria last week. The doctrine is that, if two States have a similar ideology or language or national culture, it is not the business of the world community if one of them invades the other without provocation. There are dozens of
States represented here which would be well advised to reflect deeply on the consequences for them if a doctrine of ""invasion through kinship"" were condoned.
124.	Israel followed recent events in Jordan with vigilance, restraint and a keen sense of the developing human tragedy. We could not have been indifferent to violent changes in the regional balance which would have put Israel's security in jeopardy. But it is for Arab Governments to determine their regimes and institutional structure. Israel will never move its forces in any cause except its own legitimate security. We hope that the scars of battle will be healed in Jordan and that a concerted humanitarian effort will be made to allay the vast suffering of which we have been the close witnesses in recent days. The trucks bearing medical aid dispatched by the Israeli authorities eastward across the Jordan illustrate how humane solidarities should prevail over political and military tensions. We hope that the Jordan Government will not make the error of encouraging or condoning activity by the terror groups against Israel across the ceasefire lines. This would be contrary to Jordan's international obligations, including the ceasefire, and would of course encounter Israel's firm resistance.
125.	The capacity to repeat error is revealed in the communication which the Arab Governments and the terrorist organizations signed in Cairo yesterday. There is not in that document a single, peaceful, civilized, lawful word. The talk is not of peace but of victory over an enemy ind the liberation of Israel, which means of course its extinction. That document violates the engagement which the United Arab Republic and Jordan made to Ambassador Jarring, promising to establish a just and lasting peace with Israel and to acknowledge its sovereignty and independence. The question is: which document commits the policy of those two States?
126.	Many Members have spoken here about the necessity for international action against the hijacking of aircraft. In Israel's view an agenda item on that subject would only be of value if international law came out reinforced. It is not enough to exhort parties to adopt the Tokyo Convention  or a new Convention expressive of existing law and morality. We should recall that the cooperation and States in the struggle against piracy preceded all other developments in the realm of international law. The pirate was regarded as the enemy of the human race, hostis humani generis. He was an outlaw from human society and every nation had the right and duty to apprehend and punish him with full vigor. Over a century ago, an outstanding maritime judge in Britain, Lord Stowell, expressed the current contemporary law and morality as follows:
""With professed pirates there is no state of peace.
They are the enemies of every country and at all
times and therefore are universally subject to the
extreme rights of war.""
127.	It follows that aerial piracy, which involves even more horror and peril than piracy at sea, should never be indulged, condoned, or, above all, rewarded. A firm attempt should be made to secure the unconditional release of all captives. Physical methods of prevention should be adopted without limitation or reserve. What a victory would have been won for international order if all the aircraft assaulted on 6 September had been defended as effectively as was the El A1 airliner and if all the pirates had met a similar fate. But responsibility does not lie on the terrorists alone. Some Arab Governments have given practical and moral support to successful pirates. Thus, in July 1970, we find President Nasser of Egypt himself extending a welcome to men who had hijacked a Greek aircraft and to criminals released from a prison to which Greek law had properly consigned them. At meetings last year of the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization of African Unity, Arab delegations prevented the unanimous adoption of resolutions which would strongly have condemned hijackers and required firm measures to insure their extradition and punishment. When an Arab pirate lands in certain Arab countries, he is more likely to get fuel facilities, praise and reward than arrest and punishment. The recent experience and the present debate can only be useful if condemnation is unequivocal and even then only if it leads to practical measures. I have in mind that the General Assembly might endorse the proposition which was recently made by the United States in the International Civil Aviation Organization, calling for joint international action ""to suspend all international civil air transport services to and from any State which, after the unlawful seizure of an aircraft, detains passengers, crew and aircraft contrary to the Tokyo Convention (including the destruction of such aircraft) or any State which fails to extradite or prosecute persons responsible for such acts of unlawful seizure"". Since then we have seen other drafts. The point is that only measures which lead to practical and automatic action have validity.
128.	The avoidance of reward for hijackers sometimes requires the maintenance of strong nerves. At an early stage in the recent episode there was a precipitate tendency to offer the release of convicted hijackers as a recompense for the liberation of innocent hostages. This would have saved present victims but it would have endangered other travelers on whom the released hijackers would try their skill again. It is satisfactory that this course has not been followed, and that the four countries whose aircraft or citizens had been kidnapped accepted the principle advocated by the United Kingdom and the United States, according to which solidarity should be maintained and each airline and Government would be responsible for all passengers without distinction. Faced by attitudes of principle and strengthening nerves, the hijackers understood the uselessness of their victory and gave up its fruits to the Jordanian Government and the Egyptian Embassy, which we hope will act with correct promptitude.
129.	But the release of hostages who were wantonly submitted to hardship and peril should not dull the edge of international vigilance. Israel proposes international action along four lines:
| (a) To increase security measures at airports and ! in aircraft. Israel is prepared to cooperate by sharing the knowledge and experience that it has accumulated ! in this sphere;
(b)	To call upon The Hague Conference that will convene in December 1970 to adopt the proposed convention, and to strengthen it so that the illegal capture of an aircraft, its passengers and crew will be considered an international crime calling for maximum punishment;
(c)	To establish sanctions against States that aid or provide asylum to hijackers or criminals who attack aircraft. These sanctions should include: cessation of aerial communications with the States which aid hijackers, and withholding of services from the national carrier of a State that aids or provides asylum to those who hijack or attack aircraft;
id) To call for the establishment of a special body that will deal continuously with acts of hijacking or attacks on the international level.
130.	But what about the larger issue of peace? Before we fall into despair let us recall that there are no irreconcilable conflicts in history. The ArabIsraeli conflict, for all its rhetorical bitterness, has had no results comparable in absolute or relative terms with the carnage and mass suffering of many other wars.
131.	But peace has too often been considered by international bodies in semantic formal terms, and too little in terms of human realities. It is not enough that Egypt, Israel, Lebanon and Jordan should agree on a form of words; such agreement may even be an illusion if it conceals a wide gap in intention and interpretation. What is needed most is that they, and all concerned with their deeper interests, should have a clear vision of what our region would look like and how its people would live ones hostility was replaced by peace. The most conclusive evidence, the most conclusive hallmark of peace is the open frontier. A peaceful Middle East is a Middle East in which a man would be able to travel by road and rail from Cairo through Israel to Beirut and Amman, in which Egyptian civil aircraft could traverse Israel eastward while Israeli shipping passed unimpeded through the Suez Canal. Israeli and Arab civil aircraft would land in Cairo, Lod and Amman. Railways for the transportation of heavy goods would pass from the Suez area through Kan tarah, across the Israeli coast northward. The ports of Eilat and Aqaba would plan their expansion and development in neighborly coordination. This is not a dream. This summer 55,000 Arabs from neighboring countries visited their relatives west of the Jordan. Thousands passed from Israel and the west bank across the Jordan to remote parts of the Arab world. This year nearly half a million tourists came to Israel and an approximately similar number to Egypt. Under conditions of normality and peace, the ancient splendors and the modern amenities of our countries would attract millions more, who by their very pilgrimage would join us closer to them and to each other.
132.	In the last resort, a nation's strength and greatness will be measured not by the number of its missiles but by the quality of its scholars, scientists and technicians. Why should not Israeli and Arab doctors and scientists cooperate in the common quest for learning, visit each other's institutions, lecture to each other's students, meet face to face the opportunities and the ills which are common to our region? It was no credit to the Middle East in recent weeks when cholera disease broke out in many parts and when the appeal of the Israeli Minister of Health for cooperation with his colleagues in neighboring countries went unheeded.
133.	And the senselessness and tragedy of war are most vividly expressed in the inexcusable waste of resources. In twenty-two years the Arab States and Israel have spent more than $20,000 million for military purposes. If one-tenth of that sum had been invested in a refugee solution, the problem would have been solved long ago in a way that would have promoted economic progress in all the countries in which the resettlement was made.
134.	At the present time Egypt and Israel are spending $2,000 million every year for military purposes.
135.	It would be a delusion to believe that a formal peace agreement would be followed by a relaxation of vigilance or an abandonment of security; but there would certainly be a more rational distribution between the security and the economic needs of the signatory countries.
136.	Every year the population of the leading Arab State grows by 1 million, that is to say, by a number greater that that of those in refugee camps. In conditions of war and conflict, neither the refugee problem nor the problems of increased populations can be solved, since there is no rational use of resources for human needs. My point is that peace is not a word, it is not a juridical phrase; it is a total revolution in the meaning, style and content of life. It is not a documentary device; it is a human condition, the like of which our generation in the Middle East has never known.
137.	The question is whether Arab leadership can break loose from an obsolete routine of conflict in order to explore this prospect. It is in peace and not in violence that the Palestinian Arabs will find their true destiny. For in conditions of peace Israel's eastern neighbor would be an Arab State, a majority of whose population would be composed of Palestinian Arabs, and a majority of all the Palestinian Arabs would be citizens of that State. In other words, peace settles the problem of self-determination.
138.	What I have said has always been true of the Kingdom of Jordan, whose structure, name and regime were determined not by Israel but by its Arab citizens. But most of them are Palestinian Arab citizens. Wherever the boundary is determined in the peace agreement the Palestinian Arabs on both sides of the Jordan will find a better future than that which Arafat and Habash and the hijackers can offer them.
139.	There will always be a sizable Palestine Arab community in Israel. But this will have no negative significance when close cooperation across an open frontier exists between Israel and its eastern neighbor. The original former Palestine area the Mandated area  on both sides of the Jordan will accommodate two States, Israel and an Arab State, while the area regains its natural economic unity and advances towards new forms of integration. That, at any rate, is what Israel means by peace. If we have a clear vision of our aims, it will not be difficult to work backwards from the desired result towards the process that leads towards it.
140.	In the territorial negotiation, Israel's aim will be the determination of new, secure, agreed boundaries, offering a firmer security than the old armistice lines could ever provide. In short, there are no solutions without peace, and there are no problems which peace cannot resolve.
141.	The deep humane issues which preoccupy Israel are not only those which revolve around the Middle Eastern conflict. Our Jewish destiny and responsibility inspire our concern for the plight of small Jewish minorities still lingering in Arab lands, held as hostages, forbidden to depart, discriminated against, humiliated, their property confiscated, their communal and cultural life paralyzed. The hard facts are now well known and there has been a broad international echo in recent years. Yet the suffering and misery continue and in some countries have become more intense. We therefore welcome the recent reiteration by the Secretary General, in his address on 15 June to the Royal Commonwealth Society in London, of his call for the evacuation of Jews from Arab countries and of the conviction, expressed in the introduction to his report to last year's session of the General Assembly,  that the United Nations has a moral obligation to act for their rescue. I hope that States Members of the United Nations will join the call to save these doomed communities.
142.	Of very deep concern to enlightened world opinion is the grave situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. Year after year, the representatives of Israel and other Member States have raised their voices against the discrimination to which Soviet Jews are subjected, in particular the denial of the right of those who desire to join their kinsmen in Israel. In recent years ominous antiSemitic propaganda in the Soviet Union has been intensified under the cloak of a campaign against Zionism, which is the Jewish people's liberation movement. Thousands of slanderous articles and documents, reminiscent of medieval times, have been circulated by the information media controlled by the Soviet authorities.
143.	The plight of Jews in the USSR is dramatically illustrated by the appeals for permission to leave for Israel which Jews from all parts of the Soviet Union addressed to Heads of the Soviet Government, to the Government of Israel, to the Secretary-General of the
United Nations and to others. Those appeals, giving the full names and the addresses of the signatories, have been published in the international press; they speak movingly of the suffering of separated families and of thew longing to unite their lot with the mainstream of the Jewish people. Some of the signatories have been arrested; their only crime is a desire to emigrate to Israel, which does not infringe any Soviet law. Indeed, Prime Minister Kosygin made a public statement in December 1966 promising that no obstacles would be placed in the way of Soviet Jews who wish to be united with their families in Israel.
144.	Humanity and justice call upon the Soviet Government to recognize the human rights of its Jewish citizens and to permit them freely to exercise those rights.
145.	In conclusion, let me recall that much of the work of the United Nations in its first twenty-five years has revolved around this modern encounter between the national revolutions of Israel in its small State and of the Arab nation in its expanse of multiple sovereignty. Whether the anniversary year will open a better act in the drama depends less on the General Assembly's debates than on the initiatives and decisions of Middle Eastern Governments. Israel will maintain the policy on which it decided on 4 August and reiterated on 6 September. It will fulfill its special role in the advancement of developing countries through which it has already offered training and development techniques to 12,000 future leaders of emergent societies in eighty lands. It will raise its voice and hand for the equality of nations and against discrimination and the remnants of colonialism. Above all, it will keep its mind and heart open to the prospect of a negotiated peace. Its people has the strength, the tenacity and the will to withstand the violent forces which assail its life and threaten its future. But its deepest aspiration is to deploy its energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East.
146.	The key to that future lies in a negotiation explicitly directed to the establishment of peace, and the key is now in Arab, and particularly in Egyptian, hands. It can be opened by restoring the original ceasefire situation and by treading the road of negotiation. I am prepared to use my presence here for talks with heads of Arab delegations on the establishment of peace and on the creation of an atmosphere and conditions in which a fruitful negotiation can take place. There is no rational or defensible reason for refusing such an opportunity. We do the United Nations no service if we confine ourselves to public debate and neglect the normal contacts without which no international problem has ever been or will ever be resolved.
147.	Mankind may either have a peaceful future or no future at all. Our 126 Governments will all have a share in deciding how the choice is made. If we can recapture the youthful spirit which moved the United Nations twenty-five years ago, we may yet convert past dreams into reality and present disappointments into enduring hopes."
4,1974,"ISR_prev_1998","At the outset of my remarks, I wish to associate myself with all those who have expressed sorrow and sympathy at the disaster which has befallen Honduras.
213.	Next, a special word of congratulations to the new Members of the United Nations—Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The Jewish people, which was deprived of its independence for hundreds of years, is, perhaps more than any other, in a position to value the significance of national sovereignty and spiritual freedom. In the name of Israel and its people I wish them prosperity and progress.
214.	Likewise, I cannot refrain from extending my warm greetings to Portugal, which has chosen the path of decolonization and of its own liberation from the burdens of empire.
215.	And now, turning from those who have gained their freedom to those who have not, I am in duty bound, both from a human and a Jewish point of view, it draw the attention of this Assembly, and, thereby, that of world opinion, to the suffering and distress of a small Jewish community numbering 4,500 souls, all that is left of the ancient Jewish community of Syria, which is subjected to unceasing oppression.
216.	Human rights are indivisible, and the freedom of the individual concerns us all. I am ""my brother's keeper"": it is in this spirit of international solidarity that I express the hope that the Jewish community of Syria will, as an act of humanity, be finally allowed to go.
217.	In turning now to the situation of another Jewish community -the Jews of the Soviet Union, numbering more than 3 million—I voice the hope that the Soviet Government will recognize and respect the national rights of this Jewish group and permit those who so wish to leave for Israel and be reunited with their families and their people. The Jewish people, divided a? it is between East and West, has always been the first and principal victim of wars, both hot and cold, and is second to none in its yearning for peace and detente. Conflict with Powers great and small is not our desire, but we can neither keep silent nor rest until the right of every Jew to go to Israel is recognized.
218.	The Soviet Union, as a multinational State, cannot indeed it has no right to ignore the aspirations of members of the Jewish national group to full national life in their historic homeland. It is not possible to solve the problem of the rights of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union, a problem anomalous from the national point of view, by means anomalous in human and moral terms. The granting of permission to go to Israel to those who want to go will not only solve an agonizing Jewish problem which is unique in human history, but, I believe, will also provide the solution for a Soviet problem with which the Soviet Government has struggled for many years.
219.	In expressing appreciation for what has already been done, I appeal to the Soviet Government to show greater generosity, to cease harassing those who have applied to emigrate, to release the prisoners of Zion, to open the gates, and they will earn the praises of civilized men everywhere for their humanity.
220.	Our world is at a crossroads: on the one hand, affluence, waste and indifference; on the other, starvation, short expectation of life and untold suffering. Each of the States Members of the United Nations, and the Organization as a whole, must, as soon as possible, base its economic, technological and political cooperation on the concept of one world, all of whose parts and policies are interconnected. If not, the most gloomy of prophecies on the fate of humankind will be realized, and this at a time when man has reached the heights of scientific and technological advance. Unlimited resources to eliminate starvation and sickness are at hand. What is lacking is the goodwill, human responsibility and governmental understanding to establish a new international system which will advance mankind to lives of greater dignity and happiness, lives without war, lives of plenty and spiritual satisfaction. To this end it would be well to examine anew the existing international in order to see whether it is able to cope with these great and urgent tasks.
221.	Social justice is a concept which is no longer confined to the boundaries of States. Our world is now faced with stark alternatives: to proceed along the false path, whose end cannot be seen, of a widening gap between rich and poor nations; or to embark on constructive international cooperation.
222.	As Jawaharlal Nehru so wisely put it: ""The law of life should not be the competition of acquisitiveness but cooperation, the good of each contributing to the good of all.""
223.	The alternatives faced by our generation are cooperation or decline. {Let us cooperate. Israel, though small in size and limited in resources, and itself still in the stage of development, is doing its best to cope with the manifold problems of a poor and semiarid land, and with the integration of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Nevertheless it has in the past provided such assistance as it could to other developing countries in all continents in the fields of science, education and economic and social development, and will gladly extend such aid in the future.
224.	One year has passed since the Yom Kippur War -a bloody encounter started by Egypt and Syria, reinforced by contingents from other Arab States, and enjoying the material and political support of the Soviet Union. More than 2,500 Israeli soldiers lost their lives in that war, more than 12,000 Egyptians and more than 3,000 Syrians and others. Most of them died in the bloom of youth and left bereaved parents, widows and orphans behind them. Israeli prisoners were savagely maltreated in Syrian and Egyptian prisons. More than 40,000 men were wounded, and many permanently disabled. The agony of bereavement of the widows, of the orphans and of the disabled is shared equally by the peoples on both sides of the lines.
225.	Following this war the Security Council adopted resolution 338 (1973), paragraph 3 of which reads:
""The Security Council
""Decides that, immediately and concurrently with the ceasefire, negotiations shall start between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.""
226.	It is not to the credit of the Security Council that it was only in October 1973 -24 years after the signature in 1949 of the General Armistice Agreements between Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria- that it specifically called for peace negotiations. That, at any rate, was progress and it is better late than never. But why did so important and essential a resolution have to wait until the end of the sanguinary war of October last?
227.	The disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt, and between Israel and Syria, also represent a measure of progress. Since the 1967 Arab Summit Conference in Khartoum, with its triple negatives -no peace, no recognition, no negotiations- this was a first positive step. It was taken in the light of the experience of the war, and as a result of the constructive initiative of the United States and of the remarkable efforts of its Secretary of State, Mr. Kissinger.
228.	But here, too, the same grave question presents itself: why did that come so late, and why only after bloodshed? After all, partial arrangements could have been reached without war, and before the war, both in the Suez Canal area and on the Golan Heights. In 1971 Israel responded affirmatively to the American proposal for proximity talks for a partial agreement with Egypt, and there was no reason why, as time went on, we should not have responded in the same way to proposals for similar talks with the other neighboring States. It was the other side that rejected the proposal and thus killed that constructive initiative for no good reason. In the event we did finally have face-to-face talks, that is to say, something more than proximity talks, at the first session of the Geneva Conference, at the negotiations between Israel and Egypt at kilometer 101 on the CairoSuez road, and on the occasion of the signature of the agreement with Syria in Geneva. Why then should this have been done at the cost of tens of thousands of casualties on both sides?
229.	If further proof were required, the October War showed clearly that there is not, there cannot be, and there never will be, a military solution of the ArabIsrael conflict, which persists beyond all reason and beyond all political realism: a conflict which saps the very marrow from the bones of all the peoples of the area and, despite the extensive resources of our area, debilitates their economies and their societies.
230.	Let us look at the facts. In this war the aggressors enjoyed three marked advantages which, under normal circumstances, should have been decisive: first, overwhelming strength in manpower and modern sophisticated weaponry; secondly, initiative; and, thirdly, surprise. Yet despite these great advantages the citizen army of Israel rapidly overcame the effect of the surprise, halted the forward movement of the attacking forces and passed over to a bold counteroffensive which brought Israel troops well beyond the former ceasefire lines in the Golan Heights and into large areas to the west of the Suez Canal, thus surrounding the Egyptian Third Army. I do not think that any particular military expertise is required to realize what would have happened to the aggressors' forces if, at that stage, the Security Council had not hurriedly called for a ceasefire, which, of course, it did not do earlier, before it became clear that the wheel had turned in Israel's favor.
231.	That is the essential difference between an Israeli victory and an Arab victory. If the Arab armies had triumphed, the world would have witnessed an act of genocide, whereas the Arab defeat was limited to the field of battle, and in fact opened the window to the beginnings of reason and to a small step, a very small step, in the political sphere.
232.	If, despite the advantages which the Arab armies had in manpower, armaments, initiative and surprise, these were the results of the October War, what could another war bring, besides more victims, and more suffering? Another war like that would only create new complex problems the solution of which will be infinitely more difficult.
233.	I do not mention these things with joy, but with sorrow. I do not wish to exult in the Israeli victory nor to embarrass Egypt and Syria. On the contrary, at this time when it is the duty of us all to make a special effort to advance towards a political settlement, it is incumbent that all refrain from provocative statements and disparaging slogans. I recall these things only because I want to repeat, and to emphasize, that there can be no military solution to this pernicious conflict. Reinforcement of the armaments of the Arab countries might encourage new aggression but it cannot decide the issue in a new war.
234.	After the October War, there can again be no doubt that not a single one of the problems encompassed in the ArabIsraeli dispute can be solved by war, and that, in the same way, there is no problem, including the question of the independent identity of the Palestinians, which cannot be solved by sincere negotiations between the parties. Let us therefore do our utmost to ensure that the unnecessary war of Yom Kippur 1973 will be the last war ever to be fought between Arab and Israeli.
235.	Israel has naturally drawn its conclusions from the last war. But we wish to continue to progress along the political road, which opened after the war. However, if a new war is forced on us, we shall be ready. I hope and pray that our neighbors have also drawn conclusions from October 1973, and that they agree with us that it is time to finally abandon the course of armed force so as to devote their efforts consistently, patiently and seriously to the political option.
236.	The disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt on the one hand and between Israel and Syria on the other, in which the emergency forces of the United Nations under the leadership of the SecretaryGeneral are playing a praiseworthy part, may provide a suitable opening. These agreements are not only military in character; they also have their political aspects.
237.	First, the very fact of negotiations, sometimes indirect and sometimes direct, is a political and psychological step forward for all those who desire peace in our area and in the world.
238.	Secondly, an emended period of tranquility at the fronts has also made a contribution to the creation of the new climate and also possibly of a new dynamic for a political solution.
239.	Thirdly, the disengagement agreements include the following paragraph:
""This agreement is not regarded by Egypt and Israel as a final peace agreement. It constitutes a first step toward a final, just and durable peace according to the provisions of Security Council resolution 338 (1973) and within the framework of the Geneva Conference.""5
There is a similar paragraph in the IsraelSyria agreement.6
240.	But the disengagement agreements and mutual observance of the ceasefire are not enough. We must go forward with negotiations, without prior conditions, keeping constantly in mind the idea of peace and mutual tolerance in order to plant the seeds of trust which are vital for the creation of an atmosphere of conciliation, compromise and understanding.
241.	This objective is at cross purposes with the continuation of a state of belligerency, which not only contains within itself the dangers of renewal of hostilities, with all their horror and suffering, but also diverts the major part of the human resources and the wealth of the area to the buildup and maintenance of huge armies at the cost of its social and economic development. This useless aberration has already held back an entire generation, and its persistence will cause further suffering to millions.
242.	There is a historical paradox here. The Middle East is one of the richest areas of the globe. It has natural wealth, fertile soil, abundant water for irrigation, international lines of communication, incomparable sites for pilgrimage and tourism and old, historic peoples possessed of ancient cultures and modern skills alike. But this bountifully endowed area is still, from the social and economic point of view, one of the most backward in the world.
243.	It would not be difficult to prove that the expenditure of vast treasure on weapons of war and on the maintenance of huge armies is one of the main factors in this backwardness. The Soviet Union is doing no service to the people of the area when it counts weapons of war among its main exports to some of the countries of the Middle East as if these, and not means of production and technological agreements, can raise these nations from their misery. This Soviet policy, which is inspired by a one-sided, antiIsrael attitude and by incitement to intransigence and inflexibility, is one of the principal causes of tension in the Middle East and is used deliberately as a major means of Soviet implantation in a number of the countries of the area at the expense of their sovereignty. It is a policy that stands in stark contradiction to the spirit and objectives of detente, on which the hopes of all of us rest.
244.	I am bound to state with emphasis that either detente will be global and apply to the Middle East as well, or there will be no detente at all. Detente which does not include the Middle East is without political or strategic meaning.
245.	Peace and cooperation between the peoples of our region are needed not only to strengthen our economies and develop our societies but, not less vitally, to ensure the true independence of all peoples of the Middle East. There is no validity in a peace which serves the interests of one side only; and there is no substance in a peace dictated by one side to another or by a third party extraneous to both. Such a peace will always be precarious and temporary. As Albert Einstein once said: ""Peace cannot be kept by force; it can be achieved only by understanding"". Only a peace founded on respect for the interests of both parties can be genuine, stable and durable. The geo-strategic conditions which have evolved in the Middle East make such a peace possible, that is to say, a peace which will provide on the one hand a satisfactory solution for the interests of all the Arab States and also for the needs of the Palestinians, and on the other a solution for Israel's vital need for defensible borders.
246.	Israel would be prepared to give favorable consideration to a significant territorial compromise, but it cannot compromise on its security. In short, I sincerely believe that it is possible to achieve peace agreements which will serve the reasonable interests of the parties to the dispute and will open a new chapter in the history of each of the States of the Middle East and of the whole region. But up to now the Arab States have, regrettably, pursued a sterile policy of ""not an inch"", while Israel has set her face towards peace, a peace of equitable compromise, even though it might be painful to both sides. In order to reach this lofty objective we would prefer negotiations for a full and integral peace agreement. But, if it transpires that the conditions are not yet ripe for this, the possibilities might be examined of reaching interim agreements, based on compromise, which will put an end to belligerency in its various components, that is to say, interim agreements providing for effective mutual security arrangements that in the course of time will lead to negotiations for a peace treaty which will determine, inter alia, the final borders.
247.. Israel is cognizant of the existence of the question of Palestinian identity. It holds that it can and should be resolved in the context of the settlement of the dispute with its neighbor to the east. It is there, on both sides of the Jordan, that the great majority of the Palestinian population is concentrated. Moreover, most of the citizens of Jordan are Palestinians and most of the Palestinians are Jordanian citizens. It is also a fact that the area east of the Jordan is an integral part of the historic land of Israel or Palestine and that it is already the national home of the Palestinians. If there is any ethnic significance in the Palestinian concept it applies equally to the peasant, the townsman and the Bedouin east of the Jordan and to the peasant, the townsman and the Bedouin to its west. It is in the light of these considerations that the Israel Government, on 21 July 1974, resolved that:
""The Government will work towards negotiations for a peace agreement with Jordan.
""The peace will be founded on the existence of two independent States only—Israel, with united Jerusalem as its capital, and a JordanianPalestinian Arab State, east of Israel, within borders to be determined in negotiations between Israel and Jordan. In this State, the independent identity of the Jordanian and Palestinian Arabs can find expression in peace and good neighborliness with Israel.""
248.	However, the Palestinian community in general must in no way be equated with the terrorist organizations. From my own personal acquaintance with this community I refuse to identify it, or at least its great majority, with the terrorist group known as the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], which is not a national liberation movement but the roof organization of disunited and splintered terrorist groups whose pretensions are not supported by the broad masses of the Palestinian population. It is a fact that more Arabs than Israelis have been killed by these organizations. It is also a fact that more terrorists have been killed in the armed clashes between regular Arab forces and the terror gangs and between the rival terror gangs themselves than by Israeli security forces.
249.	These facts are obvious to anybody who cares to examine them. We refuse to recognize the PLO and we will not recognize it, because of its doctrines and of its deeds alike. The charter of Palestine, which embodies the political ideology of the PLO, stands in direct contradiction to the Charter of the United Nations. It denies absolutely the right of Israel to exist and postulates its destruction as a principal objective.
250.	This ideology is accompanied by the criminal methods of warfare used by the organizations which make up the PLO, methods such as indiscriminate terror, deliberate murder of women and children, pupils and teachers, athletes at the Olympic Games, passengers on a Sw.ss airliner, chance visitors and Jewish and Christian pilgrims at airports, and Arab women workers in Galilee. In reality the situation here is not that of a subject people trying to liberate itself with its own underground forces, but of gangs of desperadoes imposing themselves on a people and attempting to form and dominate it by means of the destruction of another people: this at a time when there is ample room for two States, Jewish and Arab, to coexist in peace in the historic land of Israel or Palestine on both sides of the Jordan, their common border to be determined by negotiations.
251.	It is of course no secret that with the* parliamentary situation existing in the General Assembly, the preconceived ideas held by a great number of those taking part here, and the irrelevant considerations which guide many delegations, a majority might concede the PLO demands. A resolution that would do so will be regarded by Israel as an arbitrary resolution, one impinging on its fundamental rights, illegal and not binding in any way. Every representative here would reject a resolution which strikes at the foundation of his country's being. One cannot ask of any nation to agree to its own elimination or to commit suicide.
252.	Understanding for the needs of the Palestinians -certainly; satisfaction of the demands of arch murderers who appoint themselves as saviors- decidedly not.
253.	I regret that many Members of the United Nations do not delve into this problem thoroughly, with the consequence that, either deliberately or through misunderstanding, they reward these murderers and in so doing stoke the fires in the Middle East. Israel will not submit to violence and terror. Terrorism is an infectious disease which knows no national frontiers. Many States have already paid the price of submission to terrorism, and I am afraid that the last word has not been said on the subject. Following the latest terrorist attacks in Paris and at the Hague, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said: ""Violence, which is sometimes presented and justified as an avant-garde act, is nothing but the rising to the surface of those depths of barbarism and primitive cruelty of which humanity has devoted all its efforts to rid itself."" These are trenchant words, but there is need for action and for courageous cooperation in order to put an end to manifestations of terror before further disasters occur.
254.	The essence of the PLO is terror. It is no coincidence that whenever a concrete proposal for a political solution is put forward, the PLO leadership rises up against any such peace initiative. Its insistence on including the question of Palestine in the agenda of this General Assembly session is designed, above all, to destroy the prospects of the political efforts at the very beginning. A debate on this matter cannot fail to poison the international atmosphere. Acceptance of the PLO demands may well condemn the prospects of the negotiating process to failure, just when the first ray of light has been glimpsed on the horizon.
255.	Palestinians who wish to give constructive expression to their independent identity can be helped to do so in the context of the negotiations with Jordan. Moreover, I would not agree to a genera! settlement without including in it the satisfaction of the needs of the Palestinians. It is, after all, not Israel which has prevented the crystallization of what is known as ""Palestinian identity"". To the extent that such a desire existed among the Palestinians, it is the Arab States that have frustrated it during all these years. If not, how can one explain the fact that during 19 years of Arab rule in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank, this identity never achieved any definite form or full expression?
256.	The joint communique by Egypt, Syria and the PLO in Cairo, on 21 September 1974, also deals a blow to the prospects of a constructive solution to the issue of Palestinian identity. In the same way that the PLO bends all ,ts efforts to prevent political progress in the area, certain Arab States are whittling down the hopes for a solution of the Palestine question by granting the terrorist organizations the monopoly of representation of the Palestinians, when they know perfectly well that these organizations are not able to be a party to negotiations because of what they are.
257.	There is no sadder example of the heartless attitude of the Arab Governments than the freeze they have imposed on the status of the 1948 refugees. It is true that many of them have been absorbed in the economies of the Arab States in which they now live, but there has been a deliberate policy to prevent a constructive solution to this sore problem in order to exploit human suffering for political and propaganda ends. If the problem in itself were not so sad I would say that there is nothing more ludicrous than the annual fundraising efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to make up the deficit in its budget, and this at a time when the Arab oil States command the biggest monetary reserves in the world.
258.	Israel did not adopt this course-not towards the 600,000 Jewish refugees who fled the Arab States stripped of all their possessions and not towards the survivors of the millions of Jews destroyed by the Nazis, with the blessing of the Mufti Haj Amin el Husseini, who found refuge among his own kind in Nazi Berlin and Fascist Rome. All of these were fully absorbed in Israel -economically, socially and culturally.
259.	In the light of the vast economic opportunities which now exist in the Middle East, the refugee problem must and can be solved. Far more difficult refugee situations in other parts of the world have been solved long ago. Given goodwill -without which no problem can be resolved- the question of compensation for both Arab and Jewish refugees can be settled. Israel is contributing and will continue to contribute its share in the solution of this painful human problem.
260.	There are those who foresee the approach of war on this or that front in the Middle East. As far as Israel is concerned, we shall faithfully observe the ceasefire and the separation of forces agreements, on a reciprocal basis, until they are replaced or supplemented by new agreements. But in the same way as we shall display the utmost goodwill in seeking to achieve balanced and constructive progress in the political sphere, we shall neither submit nor lend ourselves to the blackmail of threats of war or even of war itself.
261.	We want to see progress in the efforts to achieve a political solution, both as an end in itself and as a means of avoiding war. In the face of the rapid rearmament of the other side, we shall strengthen our forces in order to prevent war or to gain victory if, God forbid, it should break out anew. At the same time, we shall continue to seek a settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. In other words, we shall prepare for the worst and hope and work for the best.
262.	In one of his recent speeches, President El Sadat said that our generation must be satisfied with the end of belligerency and that the treaty of peace would be signed by the coming generation. I am astonished that so distinguished a statesman should renounce the great and historic opportunity to bring about peace and cooperation. I trust that this was not his last word. Peace should not be postponed to the next generation. It is the duty of the generations which have taken part in the war to overcome their differences and to assure peace for their descendants. Let us all do our best to secure peace speedily in our time. It is possible. In order to achieve it, one needs perhaps more courage than is needed for the decision to go to war. Let us all demonstrate both wisdom and courage for the benefit of all the peoples of our region."
4,1983,"ISR_prev_1998","208.	 Mr. President, at the outset, permit me to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-eighth session. Since this year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Simon Bolivar, the election of the representative of a Bolivarian country to the presidency is also an expression of esteem by the international community of the ideals of Bolivar, beyond being a tribute to your nation, Panama, and indeed to the Americas as a whole. We know that your vast experience and skill will stand us in good stead in our deliberations.
209.	I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Hungary, Mr. Imre Hollai, for the able manner in which he carried out his tasks as President of the thirty-seventh session.
210.	Israel wishes to congratulate also from this rostrum Saint Christopher and Nevis on its accession to independence and to welcome it on its admission to the United Nations. We wish its people peace and prosperity.
211.	The official closing of the thirty-seventh session on 19 September marked the passage of yet another year of turbulence and incertitude. But as we begin this new thirty-eighth session, we see amply demonstrated once again the aspirations of Member States for peace and tranquillity, for equality and justice in our world. This, after all, should be the common denominator for all of us who have been meeting in this Hall. And yet it is a sad comment on the ingenuity of the human race that so little has been done in these last 38 autumns to go beyond the hopes invested in the United Nations in 1945.
212.	New wars have been erupting perennially, some more bloody than the greatest battles fought in the Second World War, and old conflicts have continued to smoulder without let-up. Significantly, the greatest problems which have faced mankind since the end of the Second World War have been dealt with outside this Organization, although it was founded on the belief that the concert of nations can and must stand up to its trials and travails together and out of common accord.
213.	It is indeed gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year. We welcome new partners in our common endeavours, for the United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality based on equal sharing of opportunities and burdens in a pluralistic world. But reality must not be cast aside; the United Nations is patently incapable of meeting its challenges, as it is, regrettably, an organization which has been hijacked to serve the narrow interests of those who would do anything to advance their particular and selfish causes, and theirs alone. The United Nations has become a forum of mercantile transactions of favours, of a complacent trampling of the principles and purposes of the Charter. These are the sad realities within which we live—realities which, however, we are not compelled to accept or adopt.
214.	There is today no evident correlation between the hopes of nations and the United Nations role in the realization of those hopes; no rational connection between the aspirations and expectations expressed at the beginning of each General Assembly session and the many acrimonious debates in committees and the flood of paper resolutions that emerge at the tail end of the sessions. This is not only the point of view of Israel; it has been dwelt upon by several Assembly Presidents in the past.
215.	Israel, of course, has had its own share of disillusionment with the United Nations. The persistence of Israel's adversaries' hatred and rejectionism has been largely tolerated here without prohibition or hindrance, primarily because of a great transfer of wealth, gratuitous and unprecedented, from the highly industrialized nations of the West to some Arab countries and the resultant concentration over the last decade of economic influence in the hands of the oil-producing Arab nations.
216.	Yet, however frustrating Israel's experience with the United Nations has seemed to be, my country has not relinquished the first flush of hope that the founding of the United Nations produced in the wake of the Second World War. Beyond its own political preoccupations at the United Nations, Israel has been observing with great concern those economic and social problems which consistently mar relations among nations.
217.	Economic issues, as well as those of war and peace and arms control, have given more cause for fear than for hope in the past year. Insecurity and distress continue to afflict the greater part of humanity.
218.	The deliberations on economic issues conducted between developed and developing nations, as well as those among the developing nations themselves, progress far more slowly than the rate at which these problems continue to grow. The gravity of these issues requires unrelenting endeavour.
219.	Israel, for its part, is willing, within the means at its disposal, to make its contribution to the advancement of international economic co-operation. In this spirit, we have recently presented our ""transitional economy plan"", already circulated at the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The aim of the plan, which is based on Israel's own experience, is the application of low-cost improvements to the rural sectors of various societies. Dozens of developing countries and international economic organizations have already expressed their interest in advancing this programme and in implementing the ideas relevant to their needs and special circumstances. We are happy to note that some developed countries have shown eagerness to incorporate parts of this project into their own development strategy for the developing and least developed countries.
220.	Israel believes in both collective and individual efforts to fight hunger on this planet and has participated actively, through its international co-operation programme, in alleviating this scourge. The United Nations system should be the central vehicle for the required international co-operation. Its ability to carry out this role efficiently must depend to a large degree on its observance of the principles of universality in participation and adherence to genuine objectives of economic development.
221.	Unfortunately, we have been witnessing an ever growing attempt to politicize international economic efforts by the injection of elements of global and regional conflicts. The developing countries are ultimately the main victims of this attitude, as precious resources for development are channelled into futile and senseless exercises totally unrelated to the pressing economic needs of the greater part of mankind.
222.	No less disturbing is the insufficient progress in the international handling of the arms race and security- building measures. Israel has long been concerned about the danger posed by nuclear armaments. It has, therefore, consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
223.	Israel naturally examines these problems from the perspective of the Middle East. We have concluded that the most credible barrier to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region would be to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone. To that end, Israel has made proposals based on the precepts of the Latin American model which had led to the conclusion of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.
224.	It is only logical that the initiative for the establishment of such a zone should originate with the States in the region, and the preliminary consultations necessary for achieving this aim must be carried out directly among them; they should be conducted in good faith and be addressed to issues pertinent to the establishment of such a zone.
225.	It is clear that only free and direct negotiations among all Middle Eastern States can ensure real progress towards the conclusion of a convention which would establish a system of mutually binding obligations on all States of the region. My delegation has been advocating this approach in the annual General Assembly debates; it introduced a draft resolution, contained in the annex to a letter dated 9 June 1981/ and formed part of the consensus on the subject. Our initiative gained wide- ranging support, and recognized leaders and experts in the field of disarmament paid tribute to Israel's position. Israel's proposal, however, was unfortunately turned down by hostile States in the region.
226.	Israel is fully aware of the many political differences between the States of the Middle East. None of those differences should be permitted to stand in the way of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Israel, for its part, stands ready to commence negotiations on this matter among the interested States of our region at any time and without any preconditions.
227.	In recent years, the suppression of human rights by many Governments around the world has reached alarming proportions. It persists in all but a few countries and is in clear violation of the principles enshrined in various international treaties and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the Middle East itself, many of the Arab regimes flagrantly violate these rights by persecuting political, ethnic and religious groups and minorities; by imprisoning political opponents without trial on a widespread scale; by humiliating, torturing and, indeed, executing many political prisoners; by staging at times large-scale massacres of their own citizens, as was the case in Hama, Syria, in February of last year; and by suppressing such fundamental liberties as freedom of expression and assembly.
228.	The Jewish people have known for centuries what it is like to suffer at the hands of cruel authoritarian regimes. Israel abhors such manifestations of repression. My country supports all sincere efforts to foster respect for and safeguarding of human rights. At the same time, it deplores attempts in this Organization and elsewhere hypocritically to divert legitimate concern for human rights in directions which serve objectionable and narrow political interests.
229.	Unfortunately, the Soviet Union's continuing harassment of Soviet Jewry remains one of the most persistent and glaring human rights problems faced by the world today. In spite of the many international agreements to which the Soviet Union is a signatory, such as the Helsinki accord,' hundreds of thousands of Jews in that country are being systematically denied the basic human right to emigrate and to be reunited with their families in Israel. At the same time, those who have been formally denied exit permits have been forced to live as outcasts in Soviet society, often for lengthy periods, having been deprived of their means of livelihood, exposed to the whims of the authorities and subjected to all manner of harassment. In some cases, Jews who apply to leave for Israel or who seek to preserve their Jewish heritage and identity are arrested and imprisoned and languish in Soviet jails and labour camps under the most inhuman conditions.
230.	Indeed, as the gates of emigration have been nearly sealed, officially inspired anti-Semitism, with the inevitable strong racist overtones, is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media and in various forms of discrimination. Regrettably, the United Nations has yet to take appropriate action on this matter, which must distress decent people everywhere and which is certainly worthy of the Organization's attention.
231.	Unfortunately, the United Nations, and the General Assembly in particular, have also done very little of a constructive nature to alleviate international tension and defuse the many conflicts which have continued to plague much of the world for several years now. The cause of neither peace nor world security has been advanced in this past year. The past year has seen the escalation of the confrontation between the super-Powers, which in turn has had grave repercussions throughout the world, particularly for the smaller nations. International tension was greatly increased when the Soviet Air Force recently deliberately shot down a South Korean airliner—an act that was overwhelmingly condemned by the international community. Most of the armed conflicts and local wars raging around the globe year ago continue to exact a heavy toll in casualties despite destruction and suffering. In Afghanistan, Kampuchea foreign intervention continue, with hundreds of thousands having been killed or injured thus far and millions rendered homeless. The Middle East is torn apart by violent inter-Arab rivalries and by a number of conflicts, of which the Arab- Israel conflict is but one. Iraq and Iran are locked in a bitter, prolonged war which has now entered its fourth year and has already claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands. Internecine strife, encouraged by Syria, has rent Lebanon. Libya has pushed ahead with its imperialistic ambitions in Chad, while seeking to subvert also other regimes in Africa and elsewhere. Various disputes have also been plaguing the western hemisphere.
232.	Although usually stemming from local factors, much of the unrest throughout the world, including the Middle East, has been sharply exacerbated by Soviet policies which have exploited tensions to generate instability and thereby broaden the scope of Soviet influence. Whether directly, as in Afghanistan, or indirectly, through such proxies as Viet Nam, Syria and Libya, the Soviet Union has, instead of contributing to world peace, aggravated crisis situations and even sparked the outbreak of hostilities. Unfortunately, this holds true also for Soviet involvement in the Arab-Israel conflict.
233.	The last decade has demonstrated that the solution of the Arab-Israel conflict is indeed possible, provided that the parties to the conflict are sincere in their efforts to resolve it. Once again it must be stressed that progress in this regard was made entirely outside the United Nations. Indeed, instead of contributing to the promotion of peace in the Middle East, the Assembly and other United Nations organs have often added to the violent rhetoric which has fanned the flames of the Arab-Israel conflict. Were we to judge matters as they are reflected in these chambers, one might easily conclude that the conflict is insoluble. However, in the real world of the Middle East itself—as distinct from the world of the United Nations—progress has been achieved, as we have seen in the cases of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty and in the recent Israel-Lebanon agreement. Once States engage in serious and direct negotiations which acknowledge their mutual legitimate needs and interests, agreement has been shown to be possible.
234.	The United Nations, manipulated by powerful blocs and automatic majorities, has generated a basic misconception concerning the essence of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
235.	The essence of the conflict has always been and remains the persistent enmity of Arab States towards Jewish national renaissance. For decades now Arab leaders have obstinately maintained that the whole region from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf must be exclusively Arab. This intolerant and exclusivist attitude has been reflected in their repressive policies directed against various non-Arab national groups in the Middle East. This, and no other, has been the primary cause also of the ongoing Arab-Israel conflict.
236.	Unfortunately, after several costly wars started by Arab States in their bid to destroy Israel, many of the Arab countries have apparently not yet realized that their designs concerning Israel are both wrong and futile. Thus, what they have been unable to achieve on the battlefield, they are now trying to achieve in the diplomatic arena. This has been demonstrated again at this podium during the last few days by the extreme language and content of the speeches made by, among others, the Foreign Ministers of Syria and Iraq.
237.	Significantly and most regrettably, representatives of Arab countries habitually referred to as ""moderates"" have not objected but acquiesced. Such indeed is their ""moderation"", which should be duly taken note of by all those nations here at the United Nations which have either deliberately or, at the very least, unwittingly aided and abetted a campaign which strives to delegitimize my country in order to dismantle it by stages.
238.	In the context just described, Arab enmity towards the State of Israel has been demonstrated very clearly in the case of the terrorist organization known as the PLO, an artificial framework which was created by the Arab Governments in the early sixties. That grouping of rival terrorist factions has always depended on the continued support of the Arab States and their allies for its very existence, as has been evidenced most vividly during and since the destruction of the PLO infrastructure in and around Beirut last year.
239.	Too many people have resorted to wishful thinking when referring to the PLO. Smooth phrases and eloquent double-talk cannot hide the PLO's true intentions and nature. Its criminal goal remains the destruction of Israel, whether in one fell swoop or in stages. In pursuing this objective, the PLO terrorists have perpetrated bloody atrocities which have struck at all, Jews and non-Jews, young and old, men, women and children. The PLO's true character and objectives must have become evident recently even to those who in the past were taken in by PLO phraseology.
240.	The continuing tragedy of Lebanon is a consequence of the havoc wreaked by the PLO and its allies over the past decade. Knowing full well the potential for subversion inherent in the PLO, Arab Governments were unwilling to tolerate the presence of this terrorist organization on their own countries' soil and, as a result, dumped that group upon Beirut and on the people of Lebanon. As a consequence, Lebanon's sovereignty was eroded and the country was tom apart by violent strife.
241.	It is well known that Israel stands for the full restoration of Lebanese sovereignty, of Lebanese independence, of Lebanese territorial integrity, of the unity of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries, as well as for the restoration of the authority of the lawful government of Lebanon within that country. Israel believes that in order to permit the attainment of that goal, all foreign forces must be withdrawn from that country. Alongside these objectives, and bearing in mind the experience of recent years, Israel's legitimate security needs must also be guaranteed and Lebanese territory must never be used again for attacks upon our citizens.
242.	The agreement concluded by Israel and Lebanon on 17 May 1983 is linked to these requirements. Israel was and remains determined to proceed towards full and speedy implementation of this agreement aimed at the restoration of Lebanese sovereignty. However, it must have become clear to everyone by now that Syria and the PLO have no more intention of respecting Lebanese sovereignty today than they did in the past.
243.	We have all heard Lebanon's emphatic and repeated demands for the withdrawal of the Syrian forces and the PLO from its territory. At the last session, Lebanese President Amin Gemayel used this rostrum to call for ""the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all non-Lebanese forces from Lebanon"". In a letter to the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference at Fez, a year ago, Lebanon explicitly demanded the termination of the Syrian and PLO presence in that country. Lebanon reiterated its demands as recently as last month. On 2 September, the Lebanese Foreign Minister wrote to the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States insisting again on Syrian and PLO withdrawal and he repeated this demand in his statement from this rostrum during the last meeting. Yet all this has been to no avail. Not only has Syria paid no heed to these demands, but it has increased its involvement in Lebanon and is engaged in direct warfare against the legitimate Government of that country. President Assad, backed diplomatically and militarily by the Soviet Union and assisted by Palestinian terrorists, continues his ruthless operations to keep Lebanon in disarray in an attempt to force Lebanon to submit to Syrian domination. Resorting to its well-known tactics of threats and extortion, Syria continues to undermine Lebanon's path to regaining its sovereignty. This is pursued by Syria directly or by proxy, and its uninhibited brutality stops at nothing.
244.	Israel's withdrawal from the Shouf Mountains, a first step in the direction of total withdrawal, was announced well in advance in order to provide the Lebanese Government and army with a chance to extend its control over that area. They were prevented from doing so by Syria and its proxies, which turned Lebanon once again into a battleground, exploiting existing enmity between groups there and encouraging all-out war against its legitimate Government.
245.	Israel welcomes the fact that a cease-fire has now been declared in Lebanon and hopes that the cessation of hostilities will endure, leading to true reconciliation, free of outside interventions and dictates. We are following the situation closely and are looking forward to the establishment of conditions which will ensure security and tranquillity along the Israel-Lebanon border. Under no circumstances will Israel agree to return to the state of affairs which prevailed until 16 months ago, when Lebanese territory was used as a base for terrorist operations against our citizens. Israel sincerely hopes and wishes to see an independent Lebanon in which a strong and stable regime exercises control throughout the country.
246.	Earlier, I had occasion to note that the United Nations has been systematically exploited in recent years as an instrument of Arab warfare against Israel. The most recent effort in this regard was the ill-conceived international conference at Geneva several weeks ago. As part of the manipulation of United Nations organs during the past decade by countries arrayed against Israel, that conference predictably served as an arena for anti-Israel slogans and made no attempt whatsoever to examine honestly and objectively the causes of the Arab-Israel conflict.
247.	Arab-Israel reconciliation can and must emanate from direct negotiations without outside interference. There is place neither for dictated nor for imposed solutions. Any overt or covert attempts to circumvent free and direct negotiations between the States of the region can only delay the peace process. A blatant example of such attempts is the so-called Fez ""peace plan"" with its calculated ambiguity and double-talk. It is intended to serve those who wish to evade direct negotiations and seek to impose long-standing and extreme Arab demands, thereby undermining the cause of peace. Any equitable and realistic solution will have to take into account the basic fact that on the territory of the former Palestine Mandate two national States have now been in existence for over three decades, one Arab and one Jewish. I refer, of course, to the Kingdom of Jordan and the State of Israel.
248.	The contribution of the United Nations and the world community at large should be to encourage discourse and dialogue rather than attitudes and trends which perpetuate and continued hostility to my country. Regrettably, the United Nations has allowed itself to be drawn into a biased position, has become entangled in a mushrooming web of unbalanced resolutions, has put itself into a straitjacket of partisan committees and has squandered vast resources and funds for dubious purposes. The time has surely come for-all to realize that a solution to the Arab-Israel conflict will be possible only if it takes full account also of the rights, interests and needs of Israel. First and foremost among these is the inalienable right of the Jewish people to self- determination and sovereignty in its homeland, the land of Israel.
249.	The Camp David accords reached after intensive direct negotiations with Egypt, with the participation of the United States of America, show what can be achieved if the parties involved approach the problem in a spirit of conciliation. These accords which fully take into account the legitimate rights and interests of the parties involved, have also set the stage for a future treaty with Jordan and have offered the Palestinian Arabs living in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district an active role in shaping their own future, initially within the framework of autonomy and afterwards during the negotiations to determine the final status of the areas in question. Anyone sincerely interested in the well-being of the Palestinian Arabs, as well as in a true peace which would take into account both the interests of Israel and those of its Arab neighbours, should welcome the progress exemplified by Camp David. By contrast, those who wish to perpetuate the Arab-Israel dispute for selfish political reasons will no doubt continue to support one-sided resolutions in this body and will seek to undermine those initiatives which have brought us closer to a genuine Arab-Israel peace.
250.	Israel welcomes the voices of reason that have come out of African capitals declaring that their contribution towards the promotion of dialogue in the Middle East will be more credible and effective when their relations with both Israel and its neighbours are normalized. In the past, the potential inherent in the relations between Israel and the developing countries in Africa and elsewhere was realized in achievements which have proved useful and of significant mutual benefit.
251.	Israel would welcome the resumption of ties and expansion of co-operation and friendship with all those who/believe, as we do, that all nations, whether or not they agree on every issue, should engage in mutual relations and dialogue. In our opinion these are elementary requirements if we are to advance the prospects of peace and co-operation in our world, The purposes of the United Nations, as defined in Article 1 of the Charter, are to maintain peace, to develop friendly relations between nations, to achieve international co-operation in the solution of international problems and to act as a centre for harmonizing the actions of countries. These noble purposes, to which the founders of the United Nations dedicated themselves in 1945, are ill served by the Organization's present unchecked drifting into their abandonment through impotence. Above all, the principle of the sovereign equality of nations has often been set aside in deference to the dictates of bloc politics and military and economic blackmail.
252.	Despite this regrettable trend, Israel remains prepared actively to support a new, positive approach. An initial step in this direction could be the jettisoning of the heavy burden of politicization in the specialized agencies, thus rendering them as useful and efficient as they were meant to be.
253.	Israel still believes that the dim record of the past must not cloud our belief in the future. The Government of Israel is prepared today as it has always been to negotiate with the neighbouring Arab States an equitable solution to the Arab-Israel conflict.
254.	From this rostrum I wish to address myself to the Arab peoples of our region and to inquire whether 36 years of war and bloodshed have solved any problems. Are we better off as a result of so many years of conflict than we would have been had our nations lived side by side in peace? Could not the billions squandered on arms procurements have been put to better use in solving urgent domestic problems, such as poverty, hunger, illiteracy and a widening social gap between rich and poor? For how long will your governments be able to divert your legitimate concern with social injustice by pursuing hostile policies against my country, policies which can only perpetuate the violence which has cost our societies so much? Indeed, for how long will your Governments be prepared to sacrifice the flower of youth on the bloody altar of war?
258. Continued hostility and war have brought our region much grief and suffering. Would it not behave us to begin a new chapter in the history of our troubled region? Would it not be better for us to turn the Middle East into an area marked by co-operation and progress? Thousands of years ago from our region went forth a vision of universal peace. Together we could fulfil that vision in our region and be a source of inspiration to the rest of the world. Therefore let us meet in a spirit of reconciliation. Let us replace tension with tranquillity, misery with prosperity, hatred with friendship. Above all, instead of war, let us have peace."
4,1977,"ISR_prev_1998","154.	Mr. President, permit me to join those representatives who have already spoken in the debate, and have offered their congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the office of President of the thirty-second session of the General Assembly.
155.	The cause of human rights received a powerful impetus this year when the President of the United States told this body on 17 March of this year that every nation has a responsibility to speak out in defence of basic rights and freedoms throughout the world. We subscribed fully to this view and we are proud that, despite intense strains and provocations, Israel has succeeded in maintaining a free, open and multiracial society in which the dignity of man and the rule of law are held supreme.
156.	Unfortunately, the record of the United Nations in the field of human rights is poor. We are witnesses here to a deplorable exercise in double standards and cynicism.
157.	We have also been disappointed that so little progress has been made in implementing the humanitarian principles of the Final Act of Helsinki. Regrettably, there has been no improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Exit from the Soviet Union, the right to leave one's country a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Final Act of Helsinki—is still severely restricted, and those Jews who do insist on their rights are subject to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment and in some cases to arrest and imprisonment. The Government of Israel once again calls on the Soviet Union to permit those Jews who wish to do so to leave in order to go to Israel to join their people and their families.
158.	May I again raise the matter of the sorry plight of the Jewish community in Syria. That community does not enjoy such basic human rights as freedom of movement or the right to be reunited with their families. There can be no valid reason for the Government of Syria to hold those 5,000 innocent people as hostages.
159.	Ever since it joined the United Nations some 28 years ago, Israel has steadily supported all significant moves by this Organization to promote and to propagate the limitation of armaments on a global scale. Although disarmament has always been closely linked with security, Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race in the Middle East.
160.	In the past three years, an estimated $US 7.5 billion in arms supplies have been delivered by East and West to Arab countries in the vicinity of Israel. In addition, about $US 22 billion worth of arms was contracted for by Arab States for delivery from the end of 1976 onwards. Israel is ready to enter into an agreement on arms limitation with all the States in the Middle East.
161.	With regard to another crucial aspect of disarmament, Israel has frequently called on its Arab neighbours to join it in direct negotiations with a view to establishing a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. Indeed, on this issue as on others, the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Fahmy, has deliberately misled this Assembly. Israel firmly believes that such negotiations should lead to the conclusion of a formal, contractual, multilateral convention between all the States of the region, on the lines of such notable precedents as the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America and the proposals for similar agreements in the areas of south Asia and the south Pacific. Unfortunately, the Arab States have totally rejected this call by Israel which, after all, is in the interests of all the people of the Middle East. On this occasion I repeat our proposal.
162.	A year ago, following the rescue by Israel of innocent hostages hijacked to Entebbe in an Air France airbus, the Vice Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany proposed that the United Nations should draft an international convention banning the taking of hostages and providing for the prosecution or extradition of the ""criminals. This was an important step in the right direction, which Israel welcomed. It is therefore very disturbing to note that the Ad Hoc Committee appointed to deal with this matter has made so little progress in attempting to draft a convention for consideration by this Assembly. If this Organization fails, because of the efforts of those who support international terror, to take even this step in the right direction, then it will have lost all credibility as an effective instrument of international action.
163.	It is regrettable that Arab States have played and continue to play a central role in encouraging international terror. It is to Arab airports that hijacked aircraft are directed by terrorists in their search for safe destinations. The recent Japan Air Lines case is a classic example. The kidnappers and murderers of public figures in Germany are graduates of the courses of the PLO.
164.	No cause can justify or condone terrorism. Terrorism is a criminal activity, totally indiscriminate in its effects, which by design strikes at the innocent and the defenceless. The issue is therefore a fundamental one for the international community. The attitude this Organization takes on the question of terrorism is a clear reflection of its moral strength and its international responsibility.
165.	So far, the record of the United Nations in combating terrorism is dismal. Not once has the Security Council convened to condemn terrorists and hijackers.
166.	I noted with interest that, after my Egyptian colleague had talked with the President and the Secretary of State in Washington on 22 September, he announced to the press that, for the first time, Egypt was prepared to accept Israel as a Middle Eastern country and to live in peace in that area. It saddened me therefore that, before this Assembly on 28 September, Mr. Fahmy chose to make a personal attack on my Prime Minister and to vilify Zionism and to launch a move to isolate Israel in this forum. He also made peace conditional on an end to immigration to Israel, and openly threatened war. It would be easy to rebut him, but I shall refrain. I shall only comment that Mr. Fahmy's double-talk does not enhance Egypt's credibility and is prejudicial to the prospects of peace in the Middle East.
167.	Israel will never limit immigration. Zionism is the life-blood of Israel. We will do our utmost to achieve peace and to prevent war; but let me remind Mr. Fahmy, when he threatens us with war, that every war launched by Egypt has ended to its considerable disadvantage. The last cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Egypt after the Yom Kippur war took place 101 kilometres from Cairo. I submit that it would be more appropriate for Mr. Fahmy to stop talking about war and concentrate on the issues of peace.
168.	Similarly, I shall not engage in polemics with any of the other Arab representatives who have made countless false and malicious allegations against Israel.
169.	However, certain facts must be recalled. We have been reminded that General Assembly resolution 181 (II) of 1947 on the partition of Palestine has not been implemented. True, but the Arab States themselves voted against that resolution, obstructed its implementation and destroyed it by force of arms. For the last 30 years they have been guilty of aggression against Israel.
170.	After every war we proposed peace, but in vain. After the 1948 war we negotiated with Abdullah, King of Jordan. We reached an agreement, which was initialled by both sides, but because of that he was assassinated by his own people while praying at the A1 Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. In 1957, we proposed to President Nasser of Egypt that Egyptian troops, and not United Nations troops, should take over Sharm el Sheikh, which controls the Strait of Tiran, on condition that Israeli vessels be guaranteed freedom of passage, but Nasser rejected our proposal. After the 1967 war, we offered to negotiate for peace: we offered to return territory in return for peace. The reply we received from the Arab countries was given to us on 1 September 1967 at the Arab Summit Conference: no negotiation, no recognition, no peace.
171.	Many representatives have referred nostalgically to the 1967 armistice lines, and seem to see an Israeli withdrawal to them as a complete solution to all the problems of the Middle East. But if the 1967 lines are the answer to the problem, why is it that peace was not achieved in the years between 1949 and 1967, when Israel's frontiers were at the pre-1967 lines? During that period the Arab States refused to negotiate peace, as they were pledged to do under the armistice agreements which they signed in 1949. The PLO, an instrument of war for the destruction of Israel, was created in 1964 when Israel was still behind the 1967 lines.
172.	There has been much talk about the territories held by Israel since the six day war. But nothing has been said about the reasons for that war; nothing of President Nasser's blockade of the Strait of Tiran and his public undertakings to annihilate Israel; nothing of Egypt's movement of forces leading up to the war; nothing of how King Hussein ignored our advice, passed on to him by General Odd Bull of the United Nations, when he joined in the attack on Israel with the forces of Egypt and Syria.
173.	We did not plan to go to war. We fought to defend ourselves from the grim fate promised us.
174.	We cannot overlook the fact that the simplistic solution, which has been advocated by so many participants in this debate, was a reality on the ground from 1949 to 1967. It brought us war.
175.	In 1973, Syria and Egypt again launched a war against Israel. After their defeat, the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East was set up in the framework of which two disengagement agreements were reached with Egypt and Syria in 1974, and an interim agreement was made with Egypt in 1975.
176.	Since then, Israel has not ceased to indicate its readiness to resume the peace negotiations at Geneva on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).
177.	In view of the many inaccurate constructions that have been put on resolution 242(1967), let us be quite clear what that resolution does say and what it does not say. It does not require Israel to withdraw unilaterally from the territories it occupied in 1967. It does not call upon Israel to leave all those territories. It does not make peace negotiations contingent upon such withdrawal. It does not fix boundaries. What it does require is negotiations between the parties to arrive at an agreed peace treaty.
178.	The wording of the resolution makes it perfectly clear that new boundaries are to be determined between the States of the region. The statement that ""secure and recognized boundaries"" must be negotiated implies that previous boundaries were not secure or recognized. The fact that new boundaries are to be reached can also be inferred from the fact that Arab and Soviet pressure for the inclusion of a reference to ""withdrawal from all the territories"" was unsuccessful.
179.	I quote Mr. Joseph Sisco, who was the United States Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization
Affairs at the time that resolution 242 (1967) was adopted. He said:
""That resolution did not say 'withdrawal to the pre-June 5 lines'. That resolution said that the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words, the question of the final borders ... is a matter of negotiations between the parties.""
This is still our position. We have to establish new boundaries, and not to return to the old ones. We have to negotiate permanent boundaries that will afford Israel security.
180.	According to resolution 242 (1967), the peace settlement must include:
""Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area . .."".
The settlement is therefore to be reached between States, and not to involve the participation of any organization whatsoever.
181.	Resolution 242 (1967) makes no mention whatsoever of the PLO. The PLO is a terrorist organization whose record is one of deliberate and indiscriminate atrocities against innocent civilians, including women and children. The PLO is governed by the Palestinian National Covenant of 1964, as amended in 1968 and reconfirmed as recently as in March of this year by the Palestinian National Council in Cairo.
182.	Article 6 of this Covenant calls for the expulsion of the vast majority of the Jewish population from our country. In article 15, it calls for the elimination of Zionism. In article 19, it calls in effect for the destruction of the State of Israel. In article 20, it makes the preposterous assertion that ""the claim of historical or spiritual links between the Jews and Palestine is [not] in conformity with historical fact..."". In article 21, it declares that ""all alternatives to the total liberation of Palestine"" are rejected-that is, any plan that falls short of the destruction of Israel.
183.	There is not a sovereign State in this Organization that would negotiate with a body calling for its destruction.
184.	Many delegations have proposed the establishment of a Palestinian State governed by the PLO on the West Bank and in Gaza. Again, this is but a futile exercise in wishful thinking, totally unacceptable to us, ignoring, as it does, the language of resolution 242 (1967) and the basic facts on the ground.
185.	A PLO mini-State on the West Bank, which could not be viable in itself, would be a base for attempts to destroy Israel. One has only to consult a map and the political programme of the PLO to realize this.
186.	The provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) were accepted by Israel as the basis of negotiation towards peace. We accepted Council resolution 242 (1967). We did not accept an amended Council resolution 242 (1967)-even if such an amendment were feasible, which it is not, Council resolution 242 (1967) derives its strength and authority from the fact that it has been accepted by the States parties to the conflict.
187.	Moreover, the United States regards resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) as the exclusive basis for a settlement of the conflict. The memorandum of agreement between Israel and the United States on the Geneva Peace Conference, signed on I September 1975, declares in article 4 that the United States
""... will oppose and if necessary vote against any initiatives in the Security Council to alter adversely the terms of reference of the Geneva Peace Conference, or to change resolutions 242 and 338 in ways which are incompatible with their original purpose"".
This position was reaffirmed by the United States only a few days ago in a joint statement with Israel.
188.	Israel is ready to resume negotiations at Geneva for the achievement of true, contractual and effective peace treaties, including the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the Arab States. There can be no participation of any additional State, group or organization at the Geneva Peace Conference without the agreement of all the initial participants. All negotiations should be conducted on a bilateral basis.
189.	Through the good offices- of the United States, we have conveyed suggestions on the substantive, and not merely on the procedural, issues.
190.	First, we have provided a draft text of a full peace treaty in all its aspects. Secondly, we have supplied details of our approach in respect of discussion and negotiation on the various issues. This part is in turn made up of two elements: first, a presentation of some of the main questions involved in a peace agreement between ourselves and each of our neighbours, questions such as Israel's security, guarantees of freedom of navigation in all international waterways, the security of the Jordan River sources in the north, a basis for coexistence with the Palestinian Arabs in the"" Gaza Strip, Judaea and Samaria, and other relevant topics—in other words, the questions which we believe we must contend with if we are to sign a final peace agreement between ourselves and each of the neighbouring Arab States. The second element comprises our ideas for resolving these questions. In our view, there should be complete normalization of relations, including diplomatic relations, trade and cultural ties. We have suggested modalities, including demilitarized zones and other arrangements.
191.	In addition, there remains the cardinal principle that the negotiations should be conducted without prior conditions or commitments. This principle means not only that neither side obligates the other to agree in advance to any condition whatsoever but also that all issues and areas are
open to negotiation. We for our part will be completely open and sincere in listening to, discussing and examining the proposals of the other parties. To illustrate this: we believe that the settlement concerning Judaea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip should be based on our living together with the Palestinian Arabs in those areas, and not on a partition of the territory.
192.	For 10 years, between 1967 and 1977, the Government of Israel was committed to territorial concessions in return for genuine peace, and this implied the redivision of the area. But to no avail.
193.	Now our view is that redivision is not the answer. Nowhere is it possible to draw a dividing line which will satisfy not only the security, but also the historical, economic and social needs of all sides. Bethlehem, a satellite town of Jerusalem and dependent on Jerusalem for its tourist trade and indeed its very existence, cannot be cut off from the holy city. Mount Scopus, the site of the Hebrew University and the Hadassah Hospital, cannot be separated from Israel. And are the Arabs in Gaza once again to be bottled up in an intolerably narrow strip of land, unable to get out without passing an international frontier? No. The model for the future must be united Jerusalem, where since 1967 Jews and Arabs have proved that they can live together harmoniously to their joint benefit, where all residents enjoy freedom of movement in all parts of the holy city and where freedom of access to the Holy Places is assured for all. There is no room—and no need—for barbed wire any more.
194.	But, for all that, had the Arabs proposed partitioning those territories between ourselves and them, we would have discussed and examined their proposal and afterwards would have decided whether we were ready to agree to it or not. In this connexion I should like to point out that we have re-examined the positions of Jordan and of the Palestinian Arabs and we have found no inclination on the part of either for a solution based on the redivision of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip.
- 195. The criticism which has been directed against Israel in respect of the establishment of settlements in Judaea and Samaria is unfounded. The settlements are legal. Under international law neither Jordan nor any other Arab State has any sovereign territorial rights in the West Bank or in any other part of what was mandatory Palestine in 1948 when the United Kingdom surrendered its Mandate. No State today has any claim of sovereignty to what was mandatory Palestine that is better than or even equal to Israel's claims.
196.	The Arab States rejected the United Nations partition resolution and, in violation of the United Nations Charter, they used force in an attempt to prevent its implementation. The Arab use of force in 1948 was an act of aggression-not of self-defence.
197.	""... an armed struggle is taking place in Palestine as a result of the unlawful invasion by a number of States of the territory of Palestine, which does not form part of the territory of any of the States whose armed forces have invaded it.""
That is what Mr. Tarasenko of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic said in the Security Council in 1948.
198.	No rights accrued to any of the Arab States from that act, and those States were in fact subject to the restrictions that international law imposes on a ""conquering"" and ""occupying"" army.
199.	Jordan's annexation of Judaea and Samaria early in 1950 was never recognized by any State other than Pakistan and the United Kingdom. The United States Department of State, at a press conference on 29 July 1977, confirmed that there were legal problems over the sovereign rights of Jordan in the West Bank.
200.	In view of this illegal annexation of the West Bank, the fourth Geneva Convention is not applicable.
201.	But even if the laws of belligerent occupation were applicable, those rules contain no restrictions on the freedom of persons to take up residence in the area involved. The fourth Geneva Convention bans forcible transfers, not voluntary acts of individuals taking up residence in the area of the West Bank. Mo Arab inhabitants have been displaced by the establishment of these Jewish settlements. Not a single Arab resident of Judaea and Samaria has been made homeless as a result of the establishment of those peaceful villages. And, above all, it is unacceptable to us that Jews should be prohibited from living in any part of their ancestral land.
202.	Let me make one point clear: the settlements will not decide the final borders between Israel and its neighbours. The borders will be decided upon in the negotiations between Israel and its neighbours. The settlements are by no means an obstacle to peace because, if they were, we should have had peace years ago.
203.	We believe that the problem concerning the status of the Arabs living in the West Bank should be settled in the framework of peace negotiations in Geneva between us and the Jordanian delegation, which may include Palestinian Arabs from Judaea and Samaria.
204.	One of the central problems that has to be solved in a peace settlement is the problem of the refugees. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) refers to ""refugees"", not ""Arab refugees"": it covers both Jewish and Arab refugees. When the resolution was being drafted, a Soviet attempt to restrict it to Arab refugees failed.
205.	The origin of the Palestinian Arab refugee problem was the Arab rejection of the United Nations partition resolution and the war which the Arab States declared against the State of Israel one day after its establishment. The responsibility is therefore theirs. Had the Arabs accepted the resolution, there would have been no refugee problem. Furthermore, because of the wars conducted by the Arab States against Israel, Jews who had lived for thousands of years in Arab lands were forced to leave, abandoning all their property and possessions. For about 590,000 Arab refugees there were about 600,000 Jewish refugees from Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Libya and the rest of North Africa. 

  

206.	Refugees in other parts of the world have been successfully integrated into the national community to which they belong. The only exception to the general rule is the situation of the Arab refugees. The Arab States have refused to absorb and integrate their brothers into their respective societies. The Arab States have made the ""restoration"" of the ""legitimate rights"" of those refugees- namely, their return to Israel—the central demand. That demand constitutes a serious distortion of the realities of the refugee problem.
207.	We do not intend to send back Jews to Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen and other Arab countries, to be hanged in the public squares of Baghdad and to be deprived of their human rights and to become third-class citizens, imprisoned in ghettoes, as in Syria now, in order to take Arab refugees in their place. The fact is that an exchange of population has taken place between Israel and the Arab countries.
208.	The difference between Israel and the Arab States is that, while we in Israel from the outset integrated all the Jewish refugees into our society, the Arab States deliberately perpetuated the ""refugee status"" of their own brethren in order to use them as a political weapon against Israel. The Arab demand for the return of the refugees to Israel, coupled with proposals for the establishment of a Palestinian State, is calculated to bring about the destruction of Israel. The refugees should be resettled and integrated into the Arab societies in which they now live. In any peace settlement specific provisions should be made to enable all refugees to find accommodation, employment and adequate compensation.
209.	In any discussion of reparations for the refugees, Israel will raise the question of reparations for Jewish refugees from Arab lands and insist that all their claims be settled within the framework of the peace agreement.
210.	There is only one road along which it is possible to move towards peace; that is the road of direct negotiations with no pre-conditions. No conflict in the world has ever been resolved without the parties to the conflict negotiating face to face. Our conflict is not different.
211.	The heart of the problem is the Arab refusal to recognize the right of Israel to national sovereignty in the ancient, historical land of the Jewish people. That is the heart of the problem, and until it is overcome the obstacles to a just and durable peace will remain.
212.	The developments of recent days and the possibility of a resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, none the less, give room for guarded optimism which could turn into grounds for great hope. For our part, we are prepared to embark on a common effort, long and challenging as it may be, to negotiate a final agreement to live in peace and security.
 
"
4,1973,"ISR_prev_1998","52.	 Mr. President, those of us who know you well take a special pride in your elevation to the presidency of the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session. The people of Ecuador share the honour which your personal qualities have justly earned.
53.	The international climate is charged with confidence and hope. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to bean organic part of our generation's life are now giving way to patient dialogue. The Viet-Nam cease-fire, the American-Chinese encounter, the summit meetings at Moscow and Washington, the German agreements and the European treaties have been succeeded by a cease-fire in Laos, by talks between North and South Korea, and by contacts between the three States of the Indian subcontinent. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is at work, bringing a tragic era of confrontation to its end.
54.	Let us leave the historians to define the precise point at which the international journey took a new direction — and the causes which inspired the change. In the meantime the results are tangible and impressive, although not yet universal. In some discussions — but not in all — the old vocabularies of abuse are being softened by a welcome air of civility. It is generally understood that coexistence must be based on a separation between viewpoints and relationships. Even when Governments differ in their ideas, their viewpoints and their policies, in their social structures and in their international orientations, they can, nevertheless, foster good relations even across the gulf of their divergences. It was the cold-war philosophy that insisted on ideological agreement or political harmony as the condition of good relations between States. The detente accepts and admits no such condition. It respects and transcends diversities of interest and outlook. Indeed, the logical conclusion of the detente is the universality of international relations. Fidelity to detente requires all States to cultivate normal relations with each other, irrespective of differences and even of conflicts in their interests or policies. At a time when States which have real conflicts of ideology, policy and interest are establishing relations with each other, it would be a grotesque paradox if States which have never had any reason to quarrel about anything were induced to weaken or to sunder their mutual ties.
55.	But we shall not do service to the spirit of detente if we carry our satisfaction beyond the point of reason and truth. Free dialogue and compromise have prevailed in many disputes, but they are still rejected in others, and the victories of international conciliation in the past few years have all been won outside the United Nations structure. This indicates that the growth of world community is painfully slow, Indeed, our Secretary-General, with admirable realism, has found it necessary, in the introduction to his annual
report o n the work of the Organization [A/9001/Add. 1], to warn us of some of the shortcomings in the work of the United Nations so far. The truth is that, while quiet, bilateral diplomacy has recorded many triumphs, strident, polemical, public debate has not brought any good result on any issue at any time. The lesson is plain. The central role of this Organization should be to promote agreements between parties to a conflict irrespective of their voting strength, and not to try to adjudicate between conflicting views on the mere basis of numerical weight. The United Nations, in short, should have a diplomatic and not a parliamentary vocation. This point was stated with great precision by the Foreign Minister of Canada. I quote his words:
""... we must try to avoid barren and abrasive confrontations, which are frequently the result of formal voting processes. Consensus is another and often surer route —  Consensus does not mean the imposition of the will of the majority on a reluctant minority which feels its vital interests are at issue; it means the shared recognition of what should and can be done."" [2126th meeting, para. 60.1
56.	Now here, in a few words, is a basic evaluation of what may be wrong with United Nations techniques. The result is not only that successes have come outside these walls; failures have abounded within them. The discussions on international terrorism by our Ad Hoc Committee ended in fiasco, as had the debate in the General Assembly after the Munich outrage last year. In Rome the International Civil Aviation Organization sat for many weeks without being allowed to agree on any amendments to the Hague or Montreal Conventions. All Members of the United Nations are united in their ability to discuss each other's imperfections. There are majorities to be had for selective political judgements against those who do not belong to a large voting bloc. But majorities cannot always be found for objective, temperate statements free of denunciation and invective.
57.	The Secretary-General's introduction to the annual report reminds us that the efforts of the United Nations in political conciliation are, in his words, ""complementary"" to ""the normal bilateral dealings of Governments"" [A/9001/ Add. 1, p. 5]. That is true. I also think that it is true that an attempt by all the Arab Governments to escape from the duty of engaging in ""the normal bilateral dealings of Governments"" to a constant reliance on public debate is one of the sources of the continuing deadlock in the Middle East. Indeed, every procedure and attitude that has proved its efficacy in other disputes has so far been ignored or rejected in our region.
58.	Would we not do well then to listen to the counsel of two statesmen whose names are pre-eminent in the history of the recent detente. Chancellor Willy Brandt of the Federal Republic of Germany has told this Assembly that
"".. . it is primarily direct peace talks between the Arab countries concerned and Israel that will best secure a balance of the elementary interests of both sides."" [2128th meeting, para. 63.]
And Mr, Kissinger, Secretary of State of the United States, has reminded us that not even the strongest of great Powers can ""substitute for the efforts of those most directly involved"" [2124th meeting, para. 56],
59.	The absence of negotiation in the Middle East is the gravest obstacle to the termination of regional tension. But it is not the parent cause of the tension. The root of the conflict lies deeper; the root of the conflict lies in the refusal of Arab Governments to come to terms with Israel as a sovereign nation rising from the depths of Middle Eastern history to resume its place in the universal community. Not one of the Arab Governments whose representatives have spoken from this rostrum about withdrawal from territories held since 1967 has said that in order to achieve their territorial claims the Arab States would recognize Israel's rightful place amongst the free nations of the area and establish permanent peace, friendship, commerce and normal relations with Israel similar, for example, to the relations which exist between the States of Western Europe, which only a short time ago were locked in hostility and war. Many Arab spokesmen say the opposite. The Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. El Zayyat, has stated in the Security Council and elsewhere that beyond the 1967 armistice lines lie the frontiers proposed in a United Nations recommendation of 1947 [resolution 181 (II)], which Egypt and other Arab Governments destroyed, as they had promised, ""by blood and fire"", and these in his learned view are the only legal frontiers. Nor would this be the end of Israel's dismantlement. An article in the official Cairo newspaper Al Gum-huriya only several days ago tells us that
""The withdrawal of Israel from all the conquered Arab territories is an initial demand of the Arab States presented as a part of the comprehensive programme aimed at putting an end to the Zionist settlement in Palestine.""
60.	From such statements it is not hard to deduce the meaning of the phrase about the ""legitimate aspirations of the Palestine Arab people"" when employed by those in whose eyes the sole representatives of that people are the organizations which carry out murder and banditry all over the world but usually at a discreet distance from the Middle East,
61.	The plain fact is that the present Arab leadership is not satisfied with the verdict of history which has led to the constitution of 18 Arab States in an area of II million square kilometres with a population of 100 million. Arab leadership seems to be in an excited imperialist mood. It demands the elimination of Israel, a non-Arab nation, older in its roots within the Middle East than any other, more venerable than any other in the lineage of spirit and tongue that ties it to that soil, unexampled in the persistence of its national identity.
62.	Israel is the very heart and core of Middle Eastern history; but Israel is a Jewish and not an Arab entity. Therefore, there are Arab leaders who cannot sustain its sovereign presence: it must be either physically eliminated or swallowed up in something else so that its ""Israel hood"" would vanish under some Arab combination or domination. In its philosophy national freedom in the Middle East is an exclusive Arab right — to be monopolized, and not to be shared. There are other expressions of this hegemonistic and exclusive spirit —  in Arab policy in the Persian Gulf and in the posturing of Colonel Qaddafi as he flaunts his opulent purse across the world. But it is in the Israeli context that the tendency to see sovereignty in the Middle East as an Arab monopoly has had its most ominous effects.
63.	Now, what I have said is admittedly a stringent view of what Arab Governments seek to achieve. But unfortunately it is sustained by a great array of official statements. It is confirmed by the implacable warfare to which Israel, alone amongst all the States of the world, has been subjected since its birth. It is nourished by outrages such as the shooting in the head of the 11 Israeli athletes, tied hand and foot, on the floor of a helicopter in Munich one year ago. Such acts are possible only if the victims are regarded by the assassins as lying outside and beyond any human context. And, indeed, the Arab hostility towards Israel today joins hands with another and deadlier hatred to which it is akin. For where else, Members of the United Nations, other than in Cairo, can you imagine the publication by writers close to the seat of power of an article which I hold in my hand and from which I read the concluding extract:
""In the whole world people have ended by understanding that Hitler was right, for the Jews are vampires which suck the blood of humanity. They wish to destroy the world, but the world vomits them. They have been chased from land to land; they were burned in the ovens of Hitler — 1 million, 2 million, 6 million. Would that he had accomplished it fully!""
That is what Al Akhbar wrote on 19 August this year.
64.	""Would that [Hitler] had accomplished it fully!"" This particular extract is only one example of hundreds of Nazi publications that have made Cairo a world centre of anti-Semitic ideology. As we listen to these obscenities on Cairo Radio, as we bury our dead after Munich or Lod, as we recall wars, assaults, boycotts and threats over these 25 years, as we read of the Covenant of the so-called ""Palestine Liberation Organization"", which asserts that only Arabs have sovereign rights in the Middle East, can we be reproached if we see ourselves as the target of a particularly virulent hatred, at variance with all humane values and vastly removed from anything that can be called detente?
65.	In short, one of the components of Israel's policy —  and I say this in great frankness —  is a profound scepticism about the basic intention of Arab States to respect Israel's sovereignty, its national identity, its cultural legacy, its place in the Middle East and the world. There is one thing, and one thing alone, that could undermine that scepticism: negotiation.
66.	For recent international experience teaches us that negotiation is not simply a procedural method: it is a principle of coexistence. Negotiation does not merely photograph established positions; it leads them towards mutual accommodation. It puts hopes and suspicions to their only viable test. At the negotiating table the discourse between the parties ceases to be rhetorical, abrasive and polemical. It becomes pragmatic, concrete, empirical. A unique kind of solidarity asserts itself between the negotiators, who become subject to the mystique of potential success and put forth their maximal effort to avoid a final break. Precisely because negotiation has such far-reaching effects, the Arab refusal to negotiate without prior conditions arouses far-reaching suspicions.
67.	We have long been convinced of the need to undertake a detailed negotiation ranging freely across all the problems at issue. If this aim has not been fulfilled, we share the
universal regret — but we disclaim culpability. We have accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967), which calls for the establishment of permanent peace by agreement between Member States in the Middle East, including withdrawal of forces from territories occupied since 1967 to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the peace agreement. We proposed detailed agendas for discussion with Egypt and Jordan, We accepted Ambassador Jarring's proposal, rejected by Egypt in March 1968, for convening Israeli and Egyptian representatives in conferences under his auspices to discuss a peace settlement. When four eminent Heads of African States visited our region in 1971, they submitted six proposals in writing, to which my Prime Minister made written and appropriate response on 28 November 1971.5 The African Presidents reported that this reply, together with that of Egypt, constituted a sufficient basis to justify negotiation. We stand by those replies today. In particular, we responded to the suggestion of the African Presidents which reads as follows:
""Acceptance by the two parties that 'secure and recognized boundaries' be determined in the peace agreement"".
68.	In 1971, when it was pointed out that direct contact might not yet be easily acceptable to Arab Governments, we agreed to the United States procedure for proximity talks. When it was then suggested that it might be difficult to conceive a sudden transition from total deadlock to total peace, we accepted the idea of a Suez agreement involving the opening of the Canal under Egyptian administration, with a limited, agreed withdrawal of Israeli forces, even ahead of a peace settlement. We stipulated that this would not be the final withdrawal, but a phase leading to further negotiations in which the permanent and final line would be agreed upon between the parties.
69.	Throughout all this period we abstained — as we still do — from changing the political and juridical status of the administered territories, and have not closed any options for a negotiated peace. We opened the river crossings and cease-fire lines to a free movement of hundreds of thousands of Arabs from areas outside Israeli jurisdiction — and indeed from all over the Arab world. We placed the Holy Places of Christendom and Islam under the administration of Christian and Moslem authorities and proposed that this principle be given appropriate statutory expression in a peace agreement. In October 1972 I suggested a meeting with Foreign Minister Riad in New York ""in order to break out of old deadlocks into a new vision and a new hope"". We utilized the good offices of foreign statesmen and other visitors to convey to Cairo and other Middle Eastern capitals our proposals for contact and dialogue in any form and at any level agreeable to the other side. We welcomed the Secretary-General of the United Nations on his visit to Member States in the Middle East, and appreciated his testimony to the will for peace that, in his words, he found in his contacts with the Government of Israel.
70.	That is not an exhaustive list of all the soundings and gestures that we have made in an effort to generate a process of negotiation. Nor have we decided to despair of the
prospect. But can anyone seriously believe that all these initiatives, all these responses — none of which was put in ultimative form — offered no opening whatever through which Arab Governments genuinely desiring peace could seek or accept a dialogue with us?
71. The Arab reactions to these and other initiatives have always included refusals to negotiate; or refusals to acknowledge Israel's statehood at all; or an insistence that Arab positions be accepted in advance by Israel as a condition of negotiation; or a demand that the situation which preceded and in large measure provoked the war of 1967 be meticulously restored.
72.	Now, there is one important thing to be noted about those positions. If all or any of them had been adopted by Governments in America, Europe and East Asia in the past few years, there would be no agreements for the General Assembly to welcome and no detente for anybody anywhere lo celebrate.
73.	I turn from the past to the future. It is natural for the Israeli Government to use this opportunity of making a precise definition of the principles which move its policy. That policy is frequently and grossly misrepresented, especially at conferences from which we are excluded while our adversaries command the scene. Our policy is to seek peace and security. If the Israeli mind is intensely preoccupied with the problem of security, it is because of the particular memories that converge upon us. On one level of recollection we come face to face with a recent experience that no other family of the human race has ever undergone. The fires are out in the gas chambers, and the ashes are silent in European fields. But the memory of our 6 million kinsmen, brutally wiped off the slate of life, and the terrible agony of the million Jewish children butchered in the year of martyrdom abide with us, vivid, stark, unforgotten. And on the other level of memory there is the experience of 25 years in which our nation's progress has been secured only at a heavy price of suffering and death,
74.	A people that has undergone such affliction and borne such loss is bound by historic duty lo insist on a very precise craftsmanship in the construction of peace. It will not do simply to reproduce the vulnerable and explosive situation which threatened world peace six years ago. Israel's statehood, its Jewish vocation, its name and flag and tongue are a part of the international reality now and for all time. They are axiomatic, and it is our business to maintain them in growing security.
75.	We are asked whether we seek peace. The answer is, Yes, that is our central aim, the destination of all our policies and hopes. Peace does not only involve a documentary acknowledgement of rights. It signifies the permanent end of conflict, and the proof of its authenticity must be sought in human terms. Peace means open frontiers across which peoples can seek commerce and contact with each other in mutual accessibility and thus give depth and meaning to formal governmental engagements.
76.	Should we not look hard and long at the European example? The aim should be a community of sovereign States in the Middle East, as in Benelux and the European communities. With our eastern neighbour, once the boundary is determined, we should seek a system of relations based on separate sovereignties but with a high measure of social and economic integration. The remarkable ease and cordiality of access between Israelis and the mass of Palestinian Arabs today should be preserved and consolidated in a peace settlement. The squalid conspiracies of Arafat and Habash, with their grenades, daggers, bombs and guns, do not represent the views or interests of the million non-Israeli Arabs west of the Jordan living in peaceful interaction with Israelis today. That is why terrorist violence has no expression there.
77.	We are asked if we accept negotiation. The answer is, Yes, by any procedure mutually agreed upon. The negotiation is between the sovereign States of the area. We must be concerned to insulate our region from the rivalries and competitions of the Powers. The Middle East, after generations of servitude, is now free. It should not seek new. hegemonies and new servitudes at the expense of its newly won independence.
78.	What about Security Council resolution 242 (1967)? The answer is, Yes, we accept it as the basis for negotiation with Egypt and Jordan, and our memorandum of 4 August 1970 remains in force. It is vital to understand what the resolution says and what it does not say. The resolution rules out withdrawal except in the context of a ""just and lasting peace"". It does not require any unconditional Israeli action without balancing actions on the Arab side. And it specifically makes provision for the establishment of secure and recognized boundaries by agreement between Member States. When Arab Governments persuade international conferences to say that resolution 242(1967) requires immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all the territories, they commit a triple forgery within a single sentence and put our documentary consensus in jeopardy. But as it stands and as it is written it is a documentary basis for negotiation,
79.	Do we accept the principle of withdrawal? Yes. In the context of a permanent peace Israeli forces would withdraw to the positions and boundaries determined mutually by the peace agreements. Our policy is not unilateral annexation but the negotiation of agreements on the final boundary. That position is in full accord with the intentions of those who drafted and sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967). One of them, Assistant Secretary Sisco, said publicly in 1970:
""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre-June 5 line, The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final, secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""
80.	We are asked about the Palestinian Arabs. If the idea is Palestine instead of Israel, our answer, of course, is, No. There is nothing ""instead"" of Israel either in universal history or in modern political reality. The question whether the Arabs have 18 or 19 States does not stand on an equal plane with Israel's solitary domain of nationhood and existence. But if the issue is Palestine side by side with Israel, the answer is that in peace negotiations with Jordan Israel's permanent boundary would be determined. It is not our governmental consensus to seek such boundary changes as would bring all or most of the Arabs of the West Bank and
their populated territories under Israeli sovereignty or citizenship. The majority of Jordan's population are Palestinians, and most of the Palestinians are Jordanian citizens. Thus an Israel-Jordan peace settlement would enable most of the Palestine Arabs east and west of the Jordan to affirm their identity and citizenship within an Arab framework. It is for Arabs and not Israelis to determine the precise constitutional structure of our eastern neighbour. In a peace settlement the area of the former Palestine Mandate on both sides of the Jordan between the desert and the sea would have two States — Israel and an Arab State which would be a Palestinian Arab State in its composition whatever its name or constitutional structure. It would be normal for Palestinian Arabs to be included in the Jordanian delegation that would negotiate peace with Israel.
81.	The principles I have outlined today would, of course, have to be submitted to negotiation with the other side. Here I seek only to emphasize that our positions are legitimate, normal and conducive to a wide range of peaceful solutions. Indeed, they are identical with the principles adopted by many States which have been praised here for their contribution to the new detente. It is possible to agree with those positions or to differ from them. But we see a moral and intellectual affront in any tendency to portray them as eccentric, as immoderate and, more grotesquely, as intransigent, when they are quite clearly nothing of the kind.
82.	Least of all is there any justification for making them the basis for abusive or punitive formulations in obedience to the pressures of Arab States which decline negotiation, refuse peace, encourage international terrorism and seek to impose their own hostilities on other States in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and dignity of newly emerging nations.
83.	Whatever has divided them in the past, the Israeli and Arab nations cannot escape their common destiny. History and geography ensure their proximity. Experience teaches us that there are no irreconcilable conflicts. If the Arab Governments will take example and inspiration from the prevailing spirit of detente, they will find in Israel a willing partner for regional development and co-operation. There would be more benefit and, above all, more honour and dignity for them and for us in the exploration of a peaceful future than in the pursuit of an ineffective and sterile rancour, which has achieved and will achieve none of its objectives but which degrades our region's name and obstructs its better visions.
84.	We shall respond affirmatively to any efforts, such as those indicated by the United States, to assist in the search for just solutions and to generate a spirit of accommodation.
85.	Israel's relations with the European community will enter a new phase with the conclusion this year of an agreement constituting a free trade area within the Mediterranean context. If the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe succeeds in its task, the Mediterranean and Middle East will benefit from the resultant growth of continental harmony. We welcome the decision of the Conference to invite Israel to present its views on matters inscribed on the Conference agenda,
86.	A central theme of the dialogue on detente in Europe, in the European Security Conference and elsewhere is liberty of movement and freedom of intellectual expression. Unless some success is registered here, there will be scepticism about the authenticity and depth of the change in the international climate. Our concern for detente should not lead us to ignore the desperate bid for freedom by men such as Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, Levich and other scientists and thinkers who fall under governmental harassment and oppression.
87.	The saga of Soviet Jewry belongs to this theme,
88.	During his visit to the United States this summer, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, Mr. Leonid Brezhnev, made a number of declarations implying that there are almost no rejections of requests by Soviet Jews to be permitted to leave for Israel. To our regret, we cannot confirm such statements at a time when so many Jews in the Soviet Union are held against their will and call out to us daily in despair. They face powerful authorities in a struggle to exercise the right, granted fortunately to many thousands of others, to join their people and their families in Israel. Applicants for emigration have in some instances been dismissed from work and left without any means of livelihood. Media of information have incited against them. Administrative molestation has made their life unbearable. Dozens of Jews, amongst them a young woman, have been condemned to long years of suffering behind barbed wire. The penalties inflicted on these people are especially surprising in view of the fact that the right to leave for Israel has been recognized in principle and that other Jews have exercised it. It is difficult to understand or condone a policy granting exit permits to some Jews while at the same time creating cruel obstacles for many others.
89.	Nor can we pass in silence over the anti-Jewish incitement conducted openly or under the cover of propaganda directed against religion or against Zionism. This campaign is still carried on through governmental media of information and by means of propaganda publications and pseudo-scientific literature. In this manner anti-Semitic ideas are disseminated and injected into the masses of the Soviet Union's population.
90.	On 26 March this year a tribunal in the French capital determined that information material distributed by the Soviet Embassy contained slanders on the Jewish faith and incitement to racial discrimination, and found those responsible guilty. But the Soviet authorities have not applied the Soviet law against the disseminators of anti-Semitic propaganda,
91.	At the same time, the Jews of Syria and the remnant still left in Iraq are living in constant torment. Israel again appeals to world opinion which has already alleviated the plight of these helpless small minorities whose only salvation lies in emigration and the pursuit of a new life.
92.	This season of the year was darkened for us in 1972 by the fearful affliction and murder of our sportsmen who went to Munich in the shelter of the Olympic flag. This year the horizon is clouded again. The kidnapping of Jewish refugees by terrorists in Austria is a reproach to international institutions whose sterile discussion of International terrorism must have given more encouragement to terrorists than they would have derived even from the absence of discussion. The decision to close the camp at Schoenau defied our belief. I recall an unforgettable day there a few months ago. In a world convulsed by nihilism and violence, it was moving to see this oasis of humane values, dedicated to the impulses of compassion and solidarity which have so often become submerged in the torrent of twentieth-century life. The very name Schoenau was recited with pride by every Austrian whom I was privileged to encounter. Those who have passed through its gates have known great suffering and torment in the tempests which have shaken Europe in this generation. To abandon such an enterprise in deference to a pair of brutal gangsters has a terrifying meaning, It raises the question where the final human victory belongs. Can law and civility triumph if they are not strongly defended? Can a decent and rational public order take root in the world if indulgence beyond their own expectation is shown to those who put a pistol to the head of unarmed wayfarers? What will be the effect of the constant suspension of European legal systems in favour of early release and impunity for those who come to kill and maim and leave their trail of innocent blood behind?
93.	The issue is not only how the safe transit of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel will be arranged, once the emigration has been authorized and the immigration approved. This is an acutely grave question, but it arises in an even graver context. What is the future of a world in which two pirates and criminals can bring a, proud nation, can bring sovereign governments to the acceptance of their terms? What are the implications of transactions and engagements between civilized governments and violent extortionists? Who is going to rule our world, governments or gunmen?
94.	The Council of Europe in its resolution entitled ""Report on the responsibility of the Member States of the Council of Europe regarding the free movement of people in Europe"", adopted on 1 October 1973, rightly expressed the hope that no government will regard itself as bound by a promise secured by extortion to terminate facilities for the transit of emigrants from the Soviet Union. All these human predicaments emerge from the developments in Vienna this week. When the civilized world stands with bowed head, along comes President El-Sadat to celebrate joyfully the triumph of the young gunmen over a few aging, weary Jews and over the sovereignty and law of an enlightened European State.
95.	Once it was an international offence to aid pirates. They were defined as humani generis hostis, enemies of the human race. Are we approaching a time when it will be an offence to resist them?
96.	Chancellor Brandt called from this platform for an effective convention against terrorism. But experience shows that if in this matter we aim at universality we shall not have the necessary parliamentary success. There is — let us face it — no effective anti-terrorist majority in the United Nations. That is an ominous truth, but nothing is gained by ignoring it.
97.	I ask myself therefore whether it would be more effective to follow the general traditions of international law by
convening like-minded interested States to discuss and formulate a convention against terrorism. The law of the seas and other instruments of international law and international co-operation evolved from the common action of a few States to which others came to adhere. Most of the historic international conventions were constructed in this way. Formulated by the few, they became the consensus of the many. The 43 States whose votes indicated their dissatisfaction with the results of last year's debate on terrorism might well consider meeting for common action, which would in the first place engage themselves and later attract a gradual but broad consensus.
98.	For it becomes more evident each day that the United Nations, frustrated in its activity in regional disputes, should concentrate more of its efforts on matters of planetary concern which require a unitary framework. Mankind has a long past and an uncertain future. Revolutions in science, in technology, in the use of energy, in industrial productivity, in demographic growth have moved forward at a rhythm too quick for the mind to absorb. Man is not at ease with his environment. The intellectual and spiritual consequences are deep. Our culture is dominated by a sense of fragmentation and instability. It expresses the special pathos of the twentieth century condition — the confidence of power and yet the sharp premonition of vulnerability both living within us, together, side by side.
99.	The United Nations may recapture some of its lost prestige and resonance if it gives first priority to those issues which have a planetary dimension. The law of the air and of the seas, the defence of air and water against pollution, the stimulation of economic growth in developing countries, the conservation of resources, the fight against famine, the establishment of a reserve of cereals in years of abundance for use in years of scarcity (following may I say, the thrifty example of our Israeli ancestor Joseph in ancient Egypt), the response to the call of hunger south of the Sahara, the response to the important initiative of President Echeverria of Mexico calling for a charter of economic rights and duties of States — those are some problems which can only be discussed and solved on a global scale. Too much of the time of the United Nations may have been spent on the regional disputes in which individual Governments have the last say — for the simple reason that they have the ultimate responsibility. In the meantime, problems have collected which because they belong equally to all nations, end up by belonging to none. Each of our national societies has its custodians and spokesmen. The question is who except the United Nations can speak for the City of Man? Who speaks in responsible tutelage of the atmosphere, the soil, the oceans, the unique life-supporting Earth?
100.	Perhaps mankind's dilemma is the United Nations opportunity. Let us, therefore, tread this ground firmly but with precision for this is the only planet that we have."
5,1986,"ISR_prev_1998","This session of the Assembly opens the fifth decade of the United Nations. I hope that it will begin an era in which this body will come closer to realizing the dreams of its founding fathers.
Their ideals were inspired and inspiring: safeguarding the principles of universality and equality, a genuine desire to maintain international peace and security, encouraging international cooperation in solving global problems and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Unfortunately, those lofty principles have been vitiated and perverted beyond recognition. Extremists have seized this body. They have compelled it to shun the only peace treaty in the Middle East - the Camp David Accords. They have forced upon it an annual ritual of adopting dozens of distorted and irrelevant resolutions relating to my country. In clinging to these barren exercises, the United Nations spends precious time and funds, resources that could profitably be used to combat
hunger and poverty.
These and other issues remain unresolved, however, and they demand serious and responsible attention. First among them is the repugnant reign of apartheid in South Africa.
Israel, founded upon basic moral and democratic values, cannot remain silent in the face of racial discrimination, wherever it nay occur.. We reject and condemn apartheid as a political, social and economic system. Israel also believes that violence is not the path to reform in South Africa. We must urgently foster a climate that will facilitate a political settlement if we are to avoid a further drift towards economic chaos, suffering and bloodshed. We hope responsible leaders on all sides will act to create such a climate and that the Government of South Africa will initiate negotiations that will satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of all South Africans, regardless of race or color.

In the heart of the African continent many continue to suffer from hunger, disease and poverty. There is a growing awareness around the world of the need to provide help. People must be fed right now. We have contributed to that effort, but we also believe that we must help countries afflicted by hunger to develop the long-term means to prevent its recurrence and to set their economies on the road to development and growth.
This past year the General Assembly convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The Organization of African unity (OAU) has outlined a development strategy that is reminiscent of Israel's own development experience. Israel announced at that special session its readiness to make immediate contributions to the attainment of those goals. We offered to share our experience in agriculture and desertification, in medicine and education and in the general field of economic development. Many in Africa remember our earlier contributions in this field. Our experience has been gained in 28 years of assistance by Israel to more than 100 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We have trained over 55,000 professionals from developing countries. We have shared our experience with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. And we are ready and willing to do more.
Many of those African States that severed relations with Israel in 1973 and 1974 are now in the process of resuming those relations. I wish to commend the leadership and courage of the Heads of State who have gone on to re-establish formal diplomatic ties with us despite the pressures exerted upon them. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all African nations and we expect many more countries to resume full diplomatic relations with Israel in the near future.
The Middle East, with its vast resources of land and minerals, has within it the potential to leap into a new age in the twenty-first century - an age of great economic prosperity and a better life for millions. But that hope hangs on the outcome of a precarious contest between those who seek progress and those who continually plunge the region into turmoil and hatred.
Perhaps the most tragic instance of the fanaticism that plagues our region is the cruel war waged by Iran and Iraq for the past six years. That war has claimed well over a million casualties; it has reintroduced outlawed means of warfare such as gas and chemical weapons and the wholesale torture of prisoners; it has hurt the entire world by threatening freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil. It is a sad commentary that, despite their various proclamations, those two warring Governments show no intention whatsoever of genuinely seeking ways to stop the horrible carnage.
Another instance of the reign of fanaticism and its terrible human cost is Lebanon. The tragedy is rooted in the chronic absence of an effective Government able to control and reconcile the warring factions. Without such a strong central authority, Lebanon has been unable to discharge the most elementary obligations of government - the control of one's territory against lawlessness and terror, terror directed against one's own citizens and against the citizens of neighboring States.
The first to pay for that anarchy have been the Lebanese themselves. Over 100,000 were slaughtered in the civil war of 1975-1976 and thousands of others have been killed since in sectarian clashes. Lebanon's Government has set no effective jurisdiction over any part of the country: not over the Bekaa Valley or Tripoli, where 20,000 Syrian troops physically occupy Lebanese territory; not over the Shouf Mountains; not even over Beirut itself. Such conditions encourage the reign of the gun, the rocket and the bomb throughout Lebanon. Naturally, the southern part of the country has not been exempt from that dismal pattern. Beginning with the PLO, various terrorist groups have used the south as a staging area for terrorist attacks against Israel. Those who expected that a ""Pax Syriana"" would pacify Lebanon were hopelessly deluded,.for Syrian domination of Lebanon has meant that Syria has been playing off one factor against another, as well as using Lebanon as a base for proxy terror attacks against Israel
and against targets world-wide.
That Syrian strategy, now shared by Iran, should concern the entire international community. As for Israel, we have one, and only one, objective regarding Lebanon: to protect northern Israel against attacks launched from Lebanon. This is self-defense in its simplest form. We shall not let Israeli citizens pay with their lives for Lebanon's failure to control its territory. We shall continue to take the necessary measures to defend our people. We hope that Lebanon will produce an effective Government with which we can agree on permanent security arrangements. In the meantime we shall continue to work with any Lebanese party genuinely interested in preventing terror in the South of Lebanon and in the North of Israel.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has tried to assist in bringing stability to the area. It has performed a useful role. It has suffered painful casualties in the process, including losses sustained in a recent rash of murderous attacks. We extend ou£r deepest condolences to the bereaved families end their Governments. We must be clear, however, on what role UNIFIL can and cannot play. International forces are most effective when they serve as buffers between two States that share a commitment to pacifying their common border. Unlike Israel's neighbors on two other borders, that is not the case with Lebanon. That is why UNIFIL, unlike the multinational Force in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, has been unable to act as an effective buffer, since the day it was established by the United Nations. Peace-keepers cannot be asked to combat terrorists. That role must be left to the Governments and the peoples in the area of turmoil. We shall continue to co-operate with UNIFIL, as we maintain the necessary security arrangements to defend our norther border.
Israel watches with concern the larger conflicts waged in our region: those between radicals and non-radicals, between conservative regimes and revolutionaries, among militant religious movements, and among the various dictatorships themselves. But there is little we can do to affect this tragic and chronic violence. Where we can act - where we have acted and shall continue to act - is in the limited confines of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.
Ever since Israel's independence we have made every effort to achieve peace with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our heritage. The Jewish people is a democratic and free people striving to rebuild its national life in the ancient - the only - homeland of the Jews. Israel is a haven for the persecuted, a land where ever Jew from whatever background feels at home. We can best achieve our ideals and goals in an atmosphere of peace and security. Hence, we cherish peace? we pray for it and we teach its blessings to our children. Our entire people rejoiced when, after decades of war which were forced upon us, we were able to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
During the past year we have made special efforts to broaden that peace. In July, Prime Minister Peres visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. We have made efforts to reinforce the peace treaty with Egypt and to solve the problems that are still outstanding. We hope we are on the threshold of a substantial improvement in the relations between our two countries. Such an improvement is vital in and of itself, and of even greater importance for the prospects for peace
with other Arab States.
A few days ago we marked the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. With the passage of time we can see that those accords were a turning-point in the history of the Middle East. They have proved decisively that there is a way out of the cycle of belligerency, and they have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no alternative to direct negotiations. To this very day they remain the one and only blueprint for accommodation and peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. All attempts to bypass, nullify or denigrate the Camp David accords have failed. Those attempts have been unsuccessful because they have disregarded the minimal needs of all parties, because they were not rooted in achievable proposals acceptable to all the sides.
Camp David accords are still the leading parties to which everyone concerned with peace in the Middle East turns. Together they hold the key to progress towards peace. With its commitment to the accords, Egypt has gained in prestige and stature. Many of those in the Arab world who once attacked and boycotted it are now looking to Egypt to play a leading role in peace negotiations. The United States, of course, is equally sought after. Many have come to appreciate the positive influence it brings to bear on the political process in our region.
For its part, Israel remains anxious and willing to move the peace process forward without delay. The peace treaty with Egypt was intended to be the first in a series of treaties that together would constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.
Those who are afraid of peace or who are seeking to evade peace with Israel are trying to promote an alternative to direct negotiations, and ultimately to peace itself, through an international conference. Let me repeat again: Experience proves that the only path to peace is through direct negotiations. Substitutes for such negotiations can only lead us away from peace. The history of our region provides anple evidence of this simple truth.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly called upon King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct peace negotiations with Israel. We recognize that once he decides to respond to our call Jordan may face considerable opposition from some Arab quarters. That opposition, however, will not be deflected or appeased by such devices as an international conference. Ultimately, Jordan will have to decide whether the advantages of peace with Israel outweigh the risks and difficulties involved in making such a move. But Jordan must understand that its peace will have to be with Israel, not with an international body. The first sign of a
genuine willingness to move towards peace is a declared readiness to deal directly with one's former adversary. There is no other way to a genuine reconciliation.
We firmly believe that the absence of democracy and freedom in our region is a major obstacle to peace. Only democracy offers the guarantee of freedom, the hope of progress and the prospect of peace. We do not believe any people want war. We do not believe the Arab peoples want war. Wars of aggression are initiated by Governments that do not represent the will of their peoples and fail to reflect their aspirations. That is why we must hope that democratic Governments will prevail throughout the Middle East on a not too distant day, for on that day true and permanent peace will come to our region. To hasten the coming of that day we call on all countries interested in peace in the Middle East strongly to support direct talks between Jordan and Israel. We call on them strongly to signify their willingness to buttress and strengthen a peace settlement by declaring their readiness to endorse it immediately. In addition, the supporters of peace should undertake to extend whatever assistance and support may be needed by the Government and the people of Jordan to embark on an ambitious development Program that will accompany the implementation of the peace treaty. The rewards of peace must be swift and exemplary, and serve to belie the words of its opponents.
Our region - the entire world in fact - is plagued by the spread of Arab terrorism. There is no limit to its atrocities. Even places of worship are not immune to this wanton murder. The recent attack on a synagogue in Istanbul was merely the latest and deadliest in a series of such attacks on Jewish places of worship. But Jews are not the only victims. Arab terror has made a blood pact with terrorists from all over the world to fight the common enemy, of which Israel and Jews are merely a part. That enemy is the community of democratic nations. The fight against this menace is therefore the fight of all civilized and free nations.
The so-called PLO was the linchpin of this alliance in terror; it pioneered the art of hijacking, bombing, kidnapping and massacre on an international scale. In the decade preceding 1982 the PLO used its mini-State in Lebanon to train and arm terrorist groups from five continents, from left-wing extremists to neo-Nazi gangs. Libya, Syria and Iran joined in financing, training and arming the terrorists and providing them with safe havens.
Since our action in Lebanon in 1982, the PLO has disintegrated into a number of rival terrorist gangs, most of them mercenaries in the service of various Governments. Their one common objective is to sabotage any attempt at peace and stability. The legacy of terror that they have created has encouraged other terrorist groups, many of them possessed by a mad desire to spread anarchy and terror for no reason whatsoever.
Much has been said about ways to combat international terrorism, but little has been done. Terrorism will continue to take its toll as long as the terrorists believe they can kill with impunity and achieve legitimacy and their political goals in the process. They must be denied these victories. They must never be appeased. They must never be ""understood"". They must always be condemned and fought vigorously. If we are serious in our desire to rid ourselves of international terrorism, we must adopt a broad and comprehensive campaign against the terrorists.
We must expel the representatives of terrorist organizations, starting with the PLO, from all countries committed to the fight against terror. We should hunt down the terrorist killers. They must always be on the run. But no matter what measures we take against the killers themselves, they will not be enough. If we do not go to the source, to the regimes whose support and protection make terrorism possible, we will not succeed in rolling back the tide of terror. We must isolate
and punish those terrorist States. We should shut down their embassies, expel their diplomats, curtail trade with them, and co-ordinate a military response if they persist in attacking us. Those who refuse to address the problem of State-supported terrorism are not merely failing to solve the problem? they are
facilitating its expansion.
Last year, from this rostrum, I spoke of three major threats facing the countries of the Middle East: the escalating race in conventional arms, the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the grave problem of chemical warfare. Unfortunately, little if anything has been done to reduce those threats. In fact, in some ways the situation has worsened in the past year.
The most dramatic development has been the increased use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran. This has been investigated by the united Nations and condemned by the President of the Security Council on behalf of its members. There is also considerable evidence that other States in the Middle East, most notably Syria, are developing a chemical warfare capability. The free world should pool information on this subject and adopt concerted measures to prevent the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons. We cannot afford to cower before dictatorships that stockpile these inhuman inventories, especially since these regimes have shown no hesitation in using them.
To our disappointment, negotiations on a nuclear-weapon-free zone among the States in the region have yet to begin. It is our firm belief that, in an area as sensitive as the Middle East, the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation would be a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries were among those which supported the establishment of our State in 1948. But things have changed. With the exception of Romania, all the Eastern-bloc countries have severed their diplomatic ties with us and adopted a one-sided policy towards the Middle East. We welcome, of course, any sincere attempt at improving relations and re-establishing diplomatic ties between us and any Eastern European country.
This year, for the first time in nearly 20 years, an official meeting took place in Helsinki between representatives of Israel and the Soviet Union. We hope that it is a sign of a positive change in the policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel. Without such a renewal of diplomatic relations and without a major change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Soviet Jews - especially the policy that prevents them from exercising their basic right of repatriation to Israel - it is difficult to see how the Soviet Union could contribute in any way to the attainment of peace in our region.
The plight of our Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union has been raised countless times by Israel's representatives and by world leaders; yet the tragic suffering continues. The hope that a new leadership in the Soviet Union would bring with it an improvement in the situation of Soviet Jewry has, so far, not been borne out. The condition of Soviet Jews, especially those among them wishing to leave for Israel, has deteriorated still further.
In a country of over 100 nationalities, speaking over 100 languages, Jews remain the only officially recognized nationality in the Soviet Union denied the right to maintain its cultural heritage and pass it on to the next generation. They are forbidden to study their ancient language, Hebrew. Throughout the entire length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not a single Jewish school where Jews may study their history, literature and traditions.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Soviet Union have expressed their desire to join their people in Israel. But the Soviet authorities have effectively stopped Jewish emigration; less than 500 Jews were allowed to leave during the first eight months of this year. Thousands have had their requests for exit permits repeatedly refused on the flimsiest of pretexts; as punishment for daring to apply to leave, they have been subjected to all manner of harassment and reprisals. Among those ""refuseniks"" are the prisoners-of-Zion, who have been subjected to arrests and lengthy terms of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. The real reason for their imprisonment is painfully clear: it is their insistence on their right to emigrate to Israel and their right to study Hebrew and persevere in their Jewish heritage.
The Soviet policy towards Soviet Jews is a flagrant violation of the International Convention on Human Rights, to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. It is totally contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Accords. The refusal of the Soviet Government to fulfill its most elementary humanitarian obligations must weigh heavily in the considerations of all who would contemplate entering into agreements with the Soviet Union on any subject.
Prom this rostrum, I call upon Governments and people of good will everywhere to urge the Soviet Government to bring its behavior towards Soviet Jews into line with universally accepted international standards. We in Israel will not rest until every Jew in the Soviet Union is permitted to exercise his right to emigrate and until Jews are free to follow their ancestral traditions and faith.
Another beleaguered Jewish community are the Jews of Syria. They are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies. They are not free to live wherever they wish. Several hundred young Jewish women cannot
find husbands in the Jewish community. The Syrian Government has callously refused to allow then to leave the country so that they may marry within their faith and establish families. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return. All that, too, is another instance of flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Syria is a signatory.
None of the problems I have described, including those relating to our region, is insoluble. They can be resolved if the Governments involved muster genuine good will, we turn again to the leaders of our Arab neighbors with an outstretched hand of peace. Let us bring an end to belligerency and hatred. Let us make real the hopes for a new era of understanding and coexistence. We shall not spare any effort in this quest, nor will we give up hope that it will bear fruit.
The eyes and hearts of millions of human beings who are wasting away from hunger and poverty, who live under oppressive regimes that deny them basic human rights, who are victims of barbaric terror, are turned towards us in the hope that we can alleviate their suffering. They look to us, to this body, for the hope of a better future. We cannot let them down and still claim fidelity to the ideals of this Organization. We bear the responsibility to begin action now for their sakes and for the sake of our place in history. Let us not forsake them, or our aspirations for a better and safer world."
5,1984,"ISR_prev_1998","It gives me pleasure, Mr. President, to associate myself with the warm congratulations offered to you from this rostrum. They are a tribute to your country and to yourself, as well as to a continent which is playing such a prominent role in the United Nations. I hope and trust that, under your leadership and guidance, the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be constructive, positive and responsive to the grave problems that face us.
101.	It is gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year, reinforced with new partners in our common endeavours. The United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality. The only attitude we should disavow is the promotion of narrow, selfish interests which run counter to our common international efforts.
102.	Every session of the General Assembly must set out in a spirit of hope that, despite the disappointments of the past, we can and should renew our efforts and work for a better world. Forty years ago, the founders of the United Nations looked back on a tragic past and undertook to forge instruments that would ensure a better future for humanity. So do we, in accordance with ancient Jewish tradition, look back year after year upon the disappointments of the past with firm belief in a better future, buoyed by an unflagging hope in the triumph of that human spirit which never deserts us.
103.	The fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War will occur in 1985, as has already been noted from this rostrum. This was a landmark in history and even more so in the annals of my people. Israel and the Jewish people, who still carry so many scars of that terrible war, will commemorate the occasion appropriately. The event will undoubtedly be marked by all nations, as was indeed recommended by the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which invited States Members ""to adopt . . . measures declaring punishable by law any dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . . including Nazi, Fascist and neo- Fascist ideologies"". The Assembly also appealed to all States to accede to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. There are still a few pockets of neo-Nazism that continue to linger, and they should be dealt with firmly, but the true heirs to this inhuman creed are those organizations and Governments that continue to this day to deny the right of existence of another State and strive for its outright destruction. There should be no room in civilized society for such doctrines or for those who promote them.
104.	The United Nations concept embraces the whole of mankind. Its raison d'etre is the welfare, present and future, of humanity, with special attention accorded to the underprivileged, the disabled and the oppressed. Our special attention should be focused on the problems of children and of youth and on their appropriate education and training. This should be our central task in building up our nations and societies.
105.	The coming year will be marked by the conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women, with the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the Decade to be held at Nairobi. Our hope is that that Conference will become a high point in women's struggle for equality and will not be exploited for narrow and barren political interests.
106.	Technological progress holds the promise of providing solutions to some of the most pressing problems of developing nations, but nowhere is it more sorely needed than in the field of agriculture and food production. It is now widely recognized that the international development effort has failed to meet its most important challenge, the production of food for the fast-growing population of our world. Agriculture is the key to the present challenge, but its development and that of the rural society that sustains it have been sadly neglected.
107.	Great strides have been made world-wide in industry, in the development of infrastructure, transportation, education and health, but food production has remained deficient. It is a terribly sad comment on our society that in this modern age millions go hungry and die of famine; hundreds of millions, mainly children, suffer malnutrition, their future as productive members of their society endangered. Per capita food production in Africa, for instance, has in fact dropped 15 per cent in the last decade. Countries in other continents have required emergency food supplies. Nations that were once self-sufficient have become importers of food and, as a result of their economic difficulties stemming from the increase in the cost of energy, their true independence has become endangered.
108.	Catastrophe awaits many nations if we do not find the way to assure adequate food for our world's growing population. World security and stability begin with the assurance of basic human needs. A change of direction is thus urgently needed in the goals of international development. That is the challenge of this decade. This goal can be reached despite the scarcity of arable land and water and despite the meagre resources that are available in various countries. In fact, Israel has emerged in only one generation from severe austerity and food rationing to self-reliance; we have increased our food production twelvefold and have become a net exporter of food.
109.	Israel recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its programme for international development co-operation. This programme had its beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the emergence of newly independent nations that sought rapid development. Imbued with a pioneering spirit that thrived on successful adaptation and innovation in the development of their own country, the people of Israel considered it a duty to share the knowledge acquired through their own rapid development experience with the peoples of other emerging nations.
110.	Israel calls upon all Governments to set aside political differences and narrow economic interests to join forces in the campaign against hunger. Israel will continue to co-operate with other nations in technology and development and stands ready to join other Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in working to meet this great challenge to humanity.
111.	Israel is the fulfilment of an age-old dream and prayer for the re-establishment of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel. It is the home of all Jews who wish to make it their home, and it is the defender and protector of all Jews who are oppressed or persecuted because they belong to the Jewish people. These principles are enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence, in its laws and in the conscience of its people.
112.	We are aghast at the fact that, 40 years after the eradication of Nazism, rampant anti-Semitism and racial discrimination still exist in a number of countries. The situation of Soviet Jewry has recently taken a definite turn for the worse. From this rostrum I call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to remove the harsh limitations and restrictions imposed upon Jews who seek repatriation and reunion with their brethren in Israel. The continued harassment of Soviet Jews has become one of the most pressing humanitarian problems of the day, a violation of the most basic human rights as expressed in the Helsinki accords. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are being systematically denied their rights and many are forced to live as outcasts, deprived of their livelihood, harassed or imprisoned in gaols and labour camps under inhuman conditions.
113.	Soviet Jews are deprived of access to Jewish culture. A systematic campaign is waged against those Soviet Jews teaching and studying the Hebrew language. Ill-concealed under the cloak of anti-zionism, officially inspired anti-Semitism is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media.
114.	We call upon the Soviet Government to change its policy, which is unjustifiable. The Soviet Jews are not involved in any anti-Soviet activity, nor are they violating Soviet laws or working against Soviet interests. Their only wish is to study their ancient culture and their national language and to live as Jews in their historic homeland. It should be recalled that in front of this very Assembly official representatives of the Soviet Union have declared that the Jewish people have a right to a State of their own. Soviet Jewry demands nothing more than to exercise this right.
115.	In our own part of the world, the Middle East, the Jews of Syria continue to suffer under a harsh regime that holds them hostage and refuses to grant them basic human rights, the most important of which is the right to emigrate and join their brethren. Periodic killings of Jews, either sanctioned or tolerated by the authorities, maintain a climate of terror among the Jews of Syria.
116.	In Ethiopia, an ancient Jewish community struggles to maintain its heritage, culture and integrity under dire hardship. We acknowledge the gesture of the Ethiopian Government, which has recently enabled Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to visit that community, and we express our sincere hope that it will take all necessary steps to protect and respect their religious and cultural rights and enable those who so desire to be reunited with their families in their ancient homeland.
117.	On 13 September 1984, a Government of national unity, encompassing the overwhelming majority of political parties in Israel, was established. Its creation is a reflection of the wide consensus that unites the people of Israel on the main issues on the Government's agenda in the economic, defence and political domains.
118.	In its foreign relations, Israel is dedicated, as always, to the goal of peace and accommodation with all its neighbours. In the north, we stand ready to reach an understanding with Lebanon which will guarantee the security of our common border and thus make possible the withdrawal of all forces from southern Lebanon. Syria remains dogmatically opposed to the idea of peace with Israel. Nevertheless, we are adamant in our conviction that there can be no solution other than peace. In the east, we have repeatedly called on the Government of Jordan to join us in negotiations for peace. In the south, of course, we have peace with Egypt, but we are convinced that peaceful relations should be deepened and strengthened in the face of so much rejectionist pressure against peace.
119.	The chances of progress towards further peace and stability between Israel and its neighbours must be appraised, however, in the context of the realities of the region.
120.	The Middle East continues to be beset by violence, bitter conflicts and wars. In a few weeks of bloodshed along the Iran-Iraq border, more men and children die than in all the Arab-Israel wars. Thousands die every year in domestic strife and hostilities entirely unconnected with the Arab-Israel conflict. Yet, as everyone in this Hall knows full well, a disproportionate amount of the time of the General Assembly is devoted year after year to a contrived and counter-productive review of the Arab-Israel conflict, the main purpose of which seems to be only to slander Israel.
121.	In the last two decades, the violence and oppression that characterize so many regimes in the Middle East have erupted on the international scene in waves of terrorism, hijacking and assassination. When in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed that the United Nations promote measures to counter international terrorism, we were among the first to welcome that initiative. Regrettably, it has been thwarted by States that sponsor and support terrorism. Middle Eastern terrorism, sanctioned by these Governments, has been thus allowed, through neglect and indifference, to expand to more and more countries. Today the cancer of terrorism has spread to all continents. The latest form of terrorism and international piracy is the mines that threaten shipping and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Recently, we were again horrified by the murderous bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a calculated and deliberate act of terrorism.
122.	Terror is a malignant disease that will spread everywhere if not contained. But at least in one instance concerted international effort has produced results. When terrorism first raised its ugly head in the mid-1960s, its prime target was international civil aviation. Planes were hijacked almost daily, aircraft bombed, passengers terrorized and murdered. The proper functioning of civil aviation today is a result of powerful measures taken jointly by many nations to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft and to combat the threat of hijackings. But such successful international co-operation remains an exception. Terrorism is still an item on the Assembly's agenda, but it is debated ineffectively, shunted aside by vested interests which offer its representatives support, sustenance and even quasi- recognition. As long as the family of nations continues to evade its responsibilities, to appease rather than punish, to pardon terrorists rather than prosecute or extradite them, to afford terrorists diplomatic immunity, the disease will spread and claim yet more victims in our homes and communities.
123.	Whenever a particularly outrageous terrorist attack takes place, as for example the recent bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a wave of outrage sweeps public opinion in all parts of the civilized world. People naturally demand instant retaliation against such despicable acts and a fitting punishment for the criminal perpetrators.
124.	While punishment has its necessary place in any system of justice, the overriding problem here is not whom to punish and how punishment should be delivered. Rather, it is how to prevent terrorism and root it out from the international arena. There is only one way to deal with this problem. Those countries which agree that terrorism must be eradicated should join forces and wage a permanent war on the terrorist organizations. This is the only way to expose, pre-empt, weaken and finally destroy them. This is a war of self-defence in its true sense, a campaign that the free world should undertake on behalf of its peoples and of the entire human race.
125.	For its part, Israel has been waging an unrelenting war on Arab terrorism and has dealt it a number of crippling blows. The so-called PLO, which had established its own mini-terrorist State in Lebanon, from which it carried out and assisted terrorist acts in five continents, was expelled from that country. But Israel cannot be expected to shoulder alone the burden of fighting international terrorism. Since we are all potential victims of terror, we must fight it together. If we do not, terrorism will endanger our basic freedoms and all the standards of civilized behaviour for which the United Nations stands.
126.	The attitude underpinning Arab terrorist attacks against Israel is the continued denial by Arab States of Israel's right to exist. Translated into wanton attacks on civilians, the ideology is cruel and inhuman. But it has produced the very opposite result to that intended. Israel has taken the necessary measures to protect its people and enable them to live and prosper alongside their Arab neighbours throughout the Land of Israel. We have to state with regret that any sign of ostensible moderation in the attitude of Arab Governments towards Israel is negated by their sustenance and support of terrorist organizations committed to Israel's destruction and by their continued attempts to expel Israel from United Nations bodies and other international organizations. We will welcome a change in the Arab stance if it is given concrete expression, such as a clear-cut disengagement from the so-called PLO and other terrorist organizations and a straightforward statement of readiness to make peace with Israel.
127.	Sadly, such a breakthrough for peace was set back by the General Assembly's rejection of the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, for no other reason than that certain Arab States reject the idea of peace with Israel. Camp David has been the only ray of light in an otherwise dismal and dark picture of hostility. It will continue to serve as a beacon of hope until its message is finally accepted by the peoples and Governments of our region.
128.	The United Nations can contribute to peace in the Middle East by a change of direction. It should embrace the idea of peace between Israel and its neighbours condemn the blatant attacks on Israel and reject outright the attempts to expel it from international forums. Recently, an attempt to expel Israel from the UPU was properly rejected by an overwhelming majority. It is now time for the United Nations as a whole to muster the courage to condemn such behaviour. It will mark an important milestone in rehabilitating the image of the United Nations and its standing in the world community.
129.	Recently, the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East was resurrected. It was advanced by a State that has no diplomatic relations with Israel and that recommends the participation of representatives of terrorist groups. The Arab-Israel dispute is not in need of another international forum. There have been more than enough such gatherings and proposals, and they have all proved futile. They served as a stage for propaganda and for competition between Arab States in the politics of public confrontation with Israel. A conference such as the one being proposed would strike a blow at the principle of direct negotiations, which has proved to be the only means of producing agreements between Israel and its neighbours, from the time of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949 through the Camp David accords in 1978.
130.	We therefore call on Member States that have the interest of peace at heart to bring their influence to bear on our Arab neighbours to the east and north to adopt the only successful and tested path to peace—direct negotiations with Israel.
131.	Such negotiations produced the agreement with Lebanon which was signed on 17 May 1983. That agreement provided for security arrangements against terrorism and an agreed basis for normal relations between our two countries across the recognized international boundaries. It was approved by the legislatures of Israel and Lebanon, but Syria and those that cannot tolerate the idea of peace with Israel destroyed it by the application of sheer, brutal force. The agreement was designed to lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the restoration of Lebanese independence and the establishment of security measures along the Lebanon- Israel border.
132.	Today, some 40,000 Syrian troops occupy 65 per cent of Lebanon and show no sign of any intention to leave. The Lebanese Government is dominated by Syria and is not capable of conducting free negotiations that would resolve its problems with Israel. Obviously, Israel will ensure its legitimate security needs and make the necessary arrangements in southern Lebanon to protect the people of northern Israel against any repetition of the terrorist attacks of recent years. I reiterate our readiness to withdraw all our forces from Lebanon, subject to the above-mentioned arrangements.
133.	By now it should be clear to everyone, including the Arab States in our area, that Israel has no interest in maintaining any military presence in Lebanon. But we have to make certain that after the last Israeli soldier leaves Lebanon, the terrorists will not return to attack us.
134.	Let me repeat: anyone, any people or State that is interested in the evacuation of the Israel army from Lebanon must see to it that the terrorist organizations expelled from Lebanon by Israel do not return to our borders to renew their attacks. This is an essential condition for peace. Israel is ready to cooperate in any serious effort towards a fair solution to this problem.
135.	Since the conclusion of the Camp David accords, Israel has repeatedly called on Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Arabs to join in negotiations for an agreement on autonomy. Unfortunately, Egypt has discontinued its participation in the talks, while Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs have refused to join them. Arab rejectionism and extremism continue to have a stranglehold on those who may have been willing to embark on the path of moderation and peace.
136.	From this rostrum, I turn yet again to our neighbours with the same call. Let us move forward together on a new path. Let us talk to one another. Let us engage in a common effort to resolve our conflicts, rather than perpetuate the negative attitudes which find frequent expression in this building.
137.	Until this call is heeded, Israel will continue to strive for an end to Arab rejectionist attitudes and aspire to mutual acceptance, tolerance, understanding and dialogue, which are consonant with the most basic goals of the United Nations.
138.	Israel is aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and of the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international arrangements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
139.	Israel has long been concerned by the dangers posed by nuclear armaments and has therefore consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
140.	We believe that the most credible barrier to proliferation in such a sensitive area as the Middle East is a freely negotiated nuclear-weapon-free zone. In this belief, we are encouraged by the Latin American experience and the recent progress towards establishing the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon- free zone.
141.	In the vital field of disarmament, we are impelled by a permanent moral imperative. Progress in this field is indispensable if we are to remove the nuclear threat. It may be a commonplace to say that time is running out, but it is nevertheless true. A very recent experience demonstrates that weapons, once they exist, are used. During the current terrible Iran- Iraq war, new non-conventional weapons, such as gas, have been used. This latest addition to the arsenal of fighting armies, against established international conventions and basic decency, cannot but arouse the deepest anxiety. It should be opposed vigorously by anyone concerned for the future of our civilization. All of us are aware that a moderation of the armament spiral, both conventional and non- conventional, will free huge resources needed for the welfare of mankind, in particular that of the developing countries.
142.	In conclusion, our mission is twofold. Our first task is the improvement of the quality of life in this world, especially for those who are suffering or who lack the means of sustenance; the hungry millions are waiting for us to do our duty. Our second task is to concert our efforts to eradicate from our midst terrorism and all other violations of civilized norms. We must dedicate equal effort to achieving both goals. We cannot accomplish our humanitarian task unless we overcome the dangers that threaten our society. Both objectives can be achieved provided we muster the courage and the will to do so. Our reward will be true peace. There can be no greater goal for the United Nations.
143.	The vision of our ancient prophets of universal peace was intended for a distant, Utopian future. But, if we succeed in removing these two formidable obstacles—hunger and terrorism—from our path, the march of humanity towards the fulfilment of that vision will be immeasurably advanced, our stride quickened and our hearts uplifted with the promise of better days."
5,1978,"ISR_prev_1998","70.	Mr. President, permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in this general debate by offering you the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will guide this session with fairness and wisdom.
71,	It is my pleasure also to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
72	As we reflect upon the work of the United Nations over the past year one undertaking stands out above all others: it is the noble attempt to reach an agreement on disarmament, to divert precious resources to improving the lot of the common man
73	In the Middle East we recently witnessed an unprecedented escalation in the quantity of weapons purchased by the Arab States, amounting to $11 billion in orders since the beginning of 1977. Indeed, over the past five years the arms agreements signed by those States mean that they have outstripped both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries members of the Warsaw Pact Organization in the ratio of their arms build-up.
74.	Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race and it remains ready to enter into agreements on arms limitation with all States in the Middle East. There is no doubt, however, that the appropriate way to bring about an arms reduction in the Middle East is through peace treaties which would include limitations on armaments within their framework Indeed, the mere transformation from a state of war to one of peace will move the States involved to dedicate their resources to economic development rather than military aims.
75.	Terrorist groups continue to threaten the lives of innocent men, women and children in different parts of the world. Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries did not continue to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. Yet we are gratified that States which once stood helplessly by have begun to assert themselves.
Mention should be made, for example, of the Federal Republic of Germany's rescue operation in Mogadishu and of the joint statement on international terrorism of the Heads of State 'or Government at the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference,6 wherein they recognized the need for immediate action to cease all flights to and from a country which refuses to extradite or prosecute hijackers of aircraft. It is only through such concerted and effective action that the world can be freed from organized terrorism.

76.	In the field of human rights no State should ignore a violation of human rights wherever it may occur in the world.
77.	Israel continues to follow closely the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. We welcome the recent increase in the number of exit visas issued, although a large number of Jews are still denied the elementary human rights to emigrate. In addition, administrative obstacles and arbitrary restrictions still threaten the social and economic livelihood and personal freedom of Jews seeking to emigrate.
78.	We have been particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences passed this year on Jews whose only crime is their desire to rejoin their families in Israel-Grigorij Goldstein, Iosif Begun, Ida Nudel, Vladimir Slepak, Simon Shnirman and Anatoly Scharansky. Those sentences caused bitter protest and indignation throughout the world. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and allow those who want to emigrate to Israel and rejoin their families to do so.
79.	We cannot be silent in the face of the increasing incitement of feeling against and defamation of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, their religion, culture and national movement, manifested day after day in the official Soviet media. Those anti-Semitic attacks, unprecedented in their intensity, may have most dangerous consequences. In this regard it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their ancient traditions and culture, and in fact take severe measures against Jews who wish to do so. We appeal Jo the Soviet Union to allow Jewish culture to be expressed freely.
80.	We also deeply regret that the Syrian Government continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and be reunited with their relatives residing in other lands.
81.	One of the most important trends in world , politics today remains the determined aspiration of the new and under-developed nations to take their place in the international political and economic arena. Being a developing nation itself, Israel strongly identifies with the aspirations of nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America to transform their political independence into a full and equal economic partnership with the older-established nations of the world.
82 To that end the North-South dialogue, with its guidelines on the transfer of resources, marks an important
beginning, and the Government of Israel appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies in encouraging this process. My Government particularly welcomes the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires, where Israel proposed a voluntary agreement for the exchange of technical assistance among developing countries. Israel has been co-operating for more than 30 years with other developing nations in fields such as irrigation techniques, seed production, desalination, solar energy and the agricultural development of arid and semi-arid zones. We view the expansion of such co-operative efforts as vital if the serious food shortages that still exist in so much of the world are to be overcome .
83.	A year ago I addressed this Assembly on the prospects of launching a peace process in the Middle East. Today I have the satisfaction of being able to address the General Assembly on the new and positive developments that have taken place recently.
84.	As all members of the Assembly know, a few weeks ago at Camp David two framework agreements8 were signed by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and witnessed by President Jimmy Carter of the United States of America. Within a very few days from now negotiations will start between Israel and Egypt for the conclusion of a peace treaty between them.
85.	It is my hope that these negotiations will be successful and that before the year is out we shall witness the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. It is our desire that the peace process should eventually embrace the other States that are our neighbours—Jordan, Lebanon and Syria-so that we may achieve a comprehensive settlement in the area.
86.	The gratitude of my country goes out to President Jimmy Carter, whose devoted efforts have made the Camp David developments possible When this achievement ends with an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, President Carter's name will be recorded in history as that of a great peacemaker.
87.	I also wish to express my country's deep appreciation to President Anwar El-Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt for his wisdom and faith. His visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 turned a new page. He decided to enter into negotiations with Israel, to recognize Israel and to make peace with Israel. This change in policy ushered in a historic change in the relations between Egypt and Israel. The previous policy based on the ""three Nos"" of Khartoum 19679—no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel—prevented any progress towards a peace settlement.
88.	Now the road to peace lies open. The warm reception accorded to President El-Sadat by the people and Government of Israel constituted an acknowledgement of this change in the Egyptian policy. A new era of peace, for which Israel has been longing since its establishment, has started. Prime Minister Begin's courage and leadership were a decisive factor. Without his readiness and ability to assume responsibility for very painful decisions, the achievements reached at Camp David would not have been conceivable.
89.	Not only since the founding of the State of Israel but since the very beginning of the Zionist movement our dream has always been of a Middle East in which Jew and Arab would live in harmony and co-operation for the mutual advantage of both peoples.
90.	The Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is a step in this direction. It provides for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilian population from Sinai; for the establishment of normal relations between the two countries, including diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and full recognition; the termination of economic boycotts and of barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and mutual protection of citizens by due process of law. It also stipulates that there shall be free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, and that the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba are international waterways to be open to all nations for navigation and over flight.
91.	In view of the several wars launched by our neighbours, we are conscious of our security needs. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of normal relations between the two States, there will be security arrangements concerning the limitation of armaments and forces in the different areas on the basis of reciprocity.
92.	Moreover, the framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel also provides for the stationing of United Nations forces at Sham el Sheikh to ensure freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran. Similarly, there is a provision for their being stationed in northern Sinai, thus creating a ""buffer zone"" between the forces stationed in El-Arish and those in Gaza. These forces will not be removed unless such removal is approved by the Security Council of the United Nations. It should be noted here that in recent years the United Nations forces in the Middle East have played a constructive role with the framework of the various agreed arrangements in the. region.
93.	It has never been the wish of Israel to exercise control over the lives and activities of the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza.
94.	We want to live as equals with the Arab inhabitants of those areas. We want to live with them, not to replace them; but at the same time we do not regard ourselves as foreigners in those areas. The Israeli settlements in Judaea and Samaria and in the Gaza district are there as of right. It is inconceivable to us that Jews should be prohibited from settling and living in Judaea and Samaria, which are the heart of our homeland.
95.	We maintain our army positions in those areas in order to ensure the security of the population of Israel, the majority of whom live in the Mediterranean coastal area. The Israeli forces are there in order to protect Israel and not in order to interfere in the lives of the Arab inhabitants. Under the agreement for the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn from those areas once a self-governing authority is freely elected by their inhabitants. The Israeli defence forces will be redeployed in those areas and maintained for security purposes. The final status of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza and their relationship with their neighbours will be negotiated during a period of five years following the establishment of the self-governing authority.
96.	One of the subjects that will be discussed between the parties will undoubtedly be the question concerning Jerusalem. For us, the city of Jerusalem is the one and only eternal capital of Israel. We have not, and we shall never have, any other capital city, whether or not others recognize it as such. This eternal city is holy to three religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. However, our connexion with it is not just religious, but derives from the totality of Jewish national history. Jerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. It is now united once again, as it should be, free and open for all to come and go. All religious communities should be in complete control of their own holy places and of their own religious life, and all should enjoy the rights of free worship. The inhabitants of the city should live together in harmony with a representative municipal council supervising all essential functions. We have resolved never again to compromise the unity of Jerusalem, and it is our hope that other peoples will share our position.
97.	It was agreed at Camp David that a peace settlement in the Middle East should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council. Resolution 242(1967) is a carefully worked out set of principles establishing a framework of peace to be negotiated among the contending States. It makes clear mat the final borders must be negotiated bilaterally among the States concerned.
98 Let us hope that all those whose co-operation is essential in obtaining peace in the Middle East will not short-sightedly remain outside the peace process. We have to find agreed and appropriate ways for Jews and Arabs to live together in equality, trust and mutual respect.















"
5,1985,"ISR_prev_1998","Sir, at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for the fortieth session. I am convinced that your wealth of diplomatic experience and proven skills will contribute to the enrichment of the deliberations during this special session.
This year we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established with many hopes and expectations in the aftermath of a world distraught by death, destruction and the plunder of war.
Like many other peoples, but significantly different from them, the Jewish people underwent an ordeal which will leave its eternal mark not only in the long annals of its history but also in its deeper spiritual and psychological experience. This was, of course, the horrendous Holocaust which was wrought upon us by nazism and anti-semitism. For this reason the emergence of the United Nations provided a source of inspiration and light for us at the end of a very dark era in our history.
Indeed, what could be more stirring than the unequivocal declarations of principle appearing in the opening paragraphs of the United Nations Charter, such as: ""We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and the call ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors""? To my great regret, however, this Organization has had a part in shattering these aspirations and noble ideals.
The slander of anti-semitism has also been propagated in the guise of anti-zionism. In this context, we sadly note the tenth anniversary of the passing of the infamous General Assembly resolution falsely equating the Jewish National Liberation Movement - Zionism - with an outrageous phenomenon totally alien to the most fundamental and spiritual values of the Jewish heritage. That resolution, 3379 (XXX), of 10 November 1975, will be remembered in the history of the United Nations as a terrible blot on its record and a discredit to the Organization and to those irresponsible Members that supported it.
Other international forums have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda and political warfare against Israel, distorting the real purposes for which they were established. It would, therefore, be appropriate and timely to strive for what I would call ""political disarmament"" in these bodies, in order to guarantee that they maintain their integrity and credibility in the exercise of their legitimate functions.
Israel was established in 1948 against the background of a United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The United Nations, however, did nothing to implement its resolution, and the State of Israel came into being through the will, the toil and the sacrifice of its people. Nor, I might add, did the United Nations alleviate the immense threats and dangers that Israel had to face since its establishment.
Since the founding of the State we have made every possible effort towards the achievement of peace and the normalization of relations with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our national heritage. The Jewish people is a small, democratic and free people, striving to rebuild its renewed nationhood in its ancient homeland. We cherish peace and we teach its blessings to our children. Indeed, after a prolonged period of strife and hostility forced on us by our neighbors, we found a way to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
Egypt and Israel have demonstrated clearly that face-to-face negotiations and direct dialog are the most constructive and beneficial ways of achieving peace. This was brought about on the basis of the Camp David Accords, which established a just and effective framework for the settlement of conflicts. It is for this reason that Israel is so insistent on applying this framework to the further extension of the peace process. We hope that in the near future we shall be able to negotiate with Jordan, our neighbor to the East. It is crucial that the peace treaty with Egypt should not remain the sole example of peace with our neighbors, and therefore we earnestly seek to widen and deepen that peace by extending the process to include the rest of our Arab neighbors.
From this rostrum I once again urge King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct negotiations with Israel - not in some vague, deflecting international forum, but in direct, bilateral discussions. An international conference is a means of evading direct negotiations. It will be a stage for hostile and extreme propaganda and will not serve the cause of peace. Our aim should be the achievement of a bilaterally negotiated peace treaty between our countries. There is no change in our deep commitment to the Camp David accords, and we stand ready therefore to meet a Jordanian delegation, which may include Arab Palestinians from Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or other Arab Palestinians to be mutually agreed upon.
Israel firmly believes that there is no way to solve the problems of our region except through negotiations and peace. If King Hussein has finally decided to offer his hand in peace, let him act the way the late President Sadat did. He should not drown the quest for peace in a sea of conditions that nullify any chance of peace - conditions such as an international conference and the participation of terrorist organizations in the peace process. I should also like to urge King Hussein to free himself at this eleventh hour, from the clutches of the PLO. King Hussein has been caught in their clutches before and it seems that he has failed to learn from his own experience. Only after freeing himself from his dangerous association with the PLO terrorists will it be possible to achieve progress towards peace between Israel and Jordan. Indeed, the recent marked increase in terror attacks against Israelis stems, among other things, from Hussein's partnership with the PLO. Jordan cannot extend the olive branch of peace on the one hand and play host to terror at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.
Our position in this regard is clear and decisive. We are firmly against any contacts or dealings with terrorists or their representatives - and, in this case, with an organization whose declared purpose is the liquidation of Israel. PLO leaders have been intimating that they are engaged in the political process of peace. However, they have been waging cruel and murderous terrorist activity all along. According to their declared program, political action and terrorist activities should go hand in hand until they achieve their goal, the elimination of Israel. He are not ready to negotiate with terror. There is no place for its self-proclaimed representatives at a table where peace, security and tranquility are to be negotiated. Acknowledging that organization would be tantamount to legitimizing terror, and should be rejected by all those who value peace.
To protect our people and territory from terror, we were obliged to act against the PLO terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, which posed an intolerable threat to our people in the Galilee region.
Meanwhile, terror continues to wreak havoc in Lebanon. The latest outrage was the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats in Beirut. Kidnapping and the holding of hostages for ransom is only one of the manifestations of international terrorism, whose linchpin is the PLO, which we roust fight and stamp out. This is another example of the fact that terror knows no bounds, neither political nor any other.
The removal of the various threats from Israel's northern border continues to be an important priority for us. We will do all in our power to defend and protect the population of the north. This objective has become no less important in the wake of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanon, in accordance with the decision of the Government of Israel of 14 January 1935.
Yesterday Israel took action against terror bases, this time in Tunisia. Israel's air force acted against the terrorists only after it became evident that the terrorists were mounting attacks from Tunis with impunity. Only last week, PLO terrorists, who were directed and commanded from Tunis, attacked an Israeli boat in Larnaca, Cyprus, and murdered three Israeli civilians in cold blood. In recent months, those headquarters were responsible for a number of seaborne attempts
against our people, which were prevented by Israel's navy. We had no intention of attacking Tunisia, although that country has permitted terrorist bases to exist on its soil. We acted against murderous criminals in order to prevent the continuation of their criminal acts.
The United Nations has been sadly remiss in meeting the challenge of international and PLO terror. It could and should have come out resolutely against this evil phenomenon of our time and placed it outside the pale of civilization. Instead, it has equivocated and, worse, legitimized terror in terms that have provided encouragement to the terrorists and their supporters.
I regret to state that, in spite of numerous outrages and continuing attacks by PLO terrorists, this issue has never been seriously addressed by the Security Council or other United Nations and international forums. Israel cannot be expected to ignore this double standard. In spite of this, Israel is willing to act with other free nations to curb, if not stamp out, terrorism. Similarly, we urge joint international action against terrorists and their sponsors.
Among the most distressing and oppressing phenomena of our international experience is racism. The very word evokes dark and brutal memories of the long history of the Jewish people. Apartheid is a system of discrimination which the Jewish faith and the State of Israel totally reject and repudiate. The Government of Israel, on 11 August 1985, reiterated that it is unconditionally opposed to the policy of apartheid in South Africa and to any discrimination on grounds of race, religion or color or on any other grounds.
Israel has diplomatic relations with some of the African States and we are ready to renew our relations with those with which we do not have them. This is, of course, up to them. We believe that many have by now seen who the real friends of Africa are: it is not those who use high-flown words but will not lend a helping hand in time of need and distress, or those who remember Africa only when they need its votes at the United Nations. The State of Israel, in contrast, was one of the first to reach out to the nations of Africa, in their early years of sovereignty and statehood and in their current travails, and we are ready to increase our efforts.
In the area of disarmament the nations of the Middle Bast are confronted with three main challenges. These are the reduction of conventional arms, the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the eradication of the use. of chemical warfare. My Government believes that concerted regional action on all three issues is a moral imperative of the highest priority.
Concerning the accumulation of conventional arras, Israel voices its concern over the accelerated supply of large quantities of weapons to a number of belligerent Arab Governments in our region. These regimes do not need these arms for their defense, but are stockpiling them to use against Israel. This can only serve to undermine the chances for peace in the Middle East.
On the subject of nuclear weapons, we believe that the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation in so sensitive an area as the Middle Bast is a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, based on a system of obligations binding' on all States concerned. Israel stands ready to begin such negotiations without delay or preconditions.
While Israel is conscious of the necessity to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are also aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful use of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international agreements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
Another issue that arouses the deepest anxiety is the repeated use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and the danger that such use may spread in a manner that could not easily be reversed, if at all. It is tragic that the sixtieth anniversary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbidding the use of such weapons should be commemorated in this manner. This total disregard for solemn international legal obligations by Iraq demonstrates the difficulty of achieving genuine disarmament. But we must not despair; we must continue our efforts in this vital field of human endeavor.
The deteriorating situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union obliges us once again to speak out in defense of their elementary rights. Our concern relates especially to the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who have indicated their desire to join their people in Israel. The Soviet authorities, however, in flagrant violation of the Helsinki Final Act and many other international obligations assumed by the Soviet Government, refuse them permission to leave.
Many of those Jews who have been denied permission to leave are forced to live as outcasts from Soviet society, subject to all manner of official harassment and persecution, while being effectively deprived of the means of legal redress. Increasing numbers have been engulfed in recent months in an accelerating wave of arrests, trials and savage sentences of imprisonment on trumped-up criminal charges. Jews seeking to disseminate knowledge of the Hebrew language have been prominent among these recent victims of judicial repression. These Jews are in no way violating Soviet law, nor are they involved in any form of anti-Soviet activity. Their real crimes, in the eyes of the authorities, are their persistent demand to leave for Israel and their efforts, in the face of strenuous official opposition, to perpetuate their Jewish heritage, culture and religion.
All of these outrages are taking place against the background of a relentless campaign of anti-semitic incitement, usually camouflaged as anti-zionism, in the officially controlled media - a campaign designed by the authorities to encourage an attitude of suspicion, hatred and contempt towards Soviet Jews on the part of the Soviet population.
We call upon all persons of goodwill and all Governments in the civilized world to join us in our protests and in urging the Soviet authorities to conform their policies towards Soviet Jewry to the international obligations solemnly undertaken by the Soviet Government.
Israel seeks good relations with all States including, naturally, the Soviet Union. We have looked to the new Soviet leadership for signs of change in its attitude towards Soviet Jewry. Regrettably, so far we have seen no positive changes whatsoever. .We therefore have no choice but to continue to expose energetically and protest vigorously these flagrant violations of the rights of our fellow Jews seeking to join their people in Israel. He shall continue to do so untiA every Soviet Jew who so wishes is free to exercise this basic right.
There is also the problem of the Jews of Syria, who are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies and are not free to choose to live wherever they wish. This is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Syria is a signatory. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return.
Several hundred young Jewish women remain unmarried because of the depleted male Jewish population in Syria. The Syrian Government has cruelly refused to allow those women to leave the country in order to be able to marry within their faith and establish families.
tJe are also concerned about the small, ancient Jewish community left in Ethiopia, because of its isolation and suffering and the latest disasters that have befallen that country. Some of these Jews have already returned to their historic homeland and have been received as long-lost brothers and sisters who have finally returned home.
The people of Israel and its Government have expressed their solidarity with the Ethiopian people, which has undergone much suffering as a result of the recent famine and other difficulties. We appeal to the Ethiopian Government to respect the cultural and religious rights of the Jewish community and to enable it to continue to maintain its heritage and religion and, on humanitarian grounds, to permit those among them who so desire to be reunited with their families in Israel.
The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations may be a fitting occasion for a review and reappraisal of its activities, in frank and constructive self-criticism.
The United Nations should not merely celebrate its past but also plan for its future.
Some may feel disheartened by the fact that, after so many years of United Nations preoccupation with the problems of the developing countries, we still remain so distant from the goal of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich nations of the world. Poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease still characterize the conditions of life in many parts of the world.
One inescapable conclusion is that progress has too often been hampered by a tendency to substitute slogans for serious plans of action. Meeting the world's pressing economic and social problems will require new dimensions of international co-operation. The danger of famine continues to afflict developing countries. There is dire need for urgent action by the world community. The peoples of Africa are struggling to free themselves from the curses of poverty and hunger, and the rest of the world must help them in this struggle.
The vital element of developing traditional agriculture has been sorely neglected. Israel is now preparing an aid proposal for more efficient food delivery systems that would provide better nutrition and would link such aid with land and water development programs.
The success of integrated rural development has been proved in Israel's own rapid agricultural development. Israel has much experience in the proper use of soil and water, marketing organization, agro-industrial systems appropriate for developing countries, and the integration of populations and development projects. He are ready to share our know-how in these fields with other developing countries. The benefits of this experience can contribute to raising living standards in many societies.	4
Israel has presented to international organizations, both within and outside the United Nations, a development proposal entitled ""Transitional Economy"". It seeks to break the vicious circle of poverty by improving the productivity and quality of life in developing countries. The proposed program seeks to combine a comprehensive development process with decentralized planning and implementation.
In the 26 years of Israel's involvement in international development efforts, Israel has co-operated with more than 100 countries and trained over 50,000 men and women in agriculture, in rural development and in health and education. During Israel's development it encountered some of the same problems that are now facing African countries and has successfully overcome them.
The United Nations may recapture some of its prestige and authority if it gives priority to these pressing social and economic issues. The magnitude of the tasks before us will require unprecedented international co-operation.
Unfortunately, the United Nations record is not very encouraging. At its last session the General Assembly had 143 items on its agenda. It passed no less than 38 resolutions relating to the Middle East, out of which 37 were negative, even hostile, in their reference to Israel. Such resolutions have long ceased to attract any attention or carry any weight. Yet the General Assembly did not see fit to address itself to such danger-spots as the Iraq-Iran war and Afghanistan, or to many of the socio-economic problems which plague our society.
Let us put aside the political differences that beset our world and join forces in an effort to find solutions for the ordinary man, woman and child, who are too often ignored in the heat of political debate. Let us work together in the spirit of the ancient prophets who gave to the world the concept of the brotherhood of man, a concept which has been the basis for the great ideals of mankind.
In the present age of unprecedented opportunities, Israel calls upon all Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations to rise to the challenge offered by science and technology. Let us share the fruits of scientific and technological advances to improve our lives. Let us build a moral and prosperous future to achieve justice and dignity for all. Let the United Nations become, truly, a ""United Nations for a better world""."
5,1996,"ISR_prev_1998","Allow
me first, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his
unanimous election as President of the General Assembly
at its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I
would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas
do Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried
out his duties.
The succession of Governments, which is a defining
principle of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to
power a new Government in Israel. A section of the
international community has deemed this democratic Israeli
choice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against
regional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to
make a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for
peace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers
on one side and mischief-makers and people who reject
peace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right
converge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and
differences notwithstanding.
I wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab
peace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding
the practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new
majority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve
peace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding
landmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The
Madrid Conference, to which I had the honour of
contributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of
peace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are
the direct heirs.
The firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government
with respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the
peace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and
Jordan, helped to shape. However, my Government’s swift
engagement in the peace process has been minimized,
reduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel
and I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian
Authority have been met with sarcasm and given only
secondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely
with the substance and the content of peace. They
initiated the ways and means necessary for the
achievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of
the Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian
recognition to new sections of society and Israeli political
classes. It is Israel’s determination to reach peace
according to the policies and fundamental guidelines of
the new Government.
On its road to peace, the Government of Israel is
guided by several principles, which I would like to
expound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a
blind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a
region where, unfortunately, threats and instability still
rage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture
of peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along
behind a process in which terrorism and violence have not
yet spoken their last word.
Negotiations themselves, through their joint creative
energies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The
battle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its
sources of financing and assistance is not only for us to
fight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations
relentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It
is imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process free from violence.
I have just returned from the Washington summit,
held at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of
the Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this
rostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State
of the United States for their exemplary contribution to
peace by bringing the parties together and for their
profound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.
In this respect the role and contribution of the United
States remain of great importance.
On Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will
convene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in
respect of the various agreements. We are responsible to
our people and to our whole region in this matter. We
must therefore display good faith and mutual
understanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send
out the message of stable peace and lasting security.
12


The Washington summit reconfirmed the principles
and guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself
wholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-
to-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the
key to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the
renunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of
mutual efforts for peace.
The choice is in our hands. Will we opt for
cooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we
revert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and
violence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,
Israel has chosen hope.
Another major principle in our search for peace is the
will of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.
Regional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace
and stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic
hegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of
regional cooperation. This is a basic principle of
normalization. Peace and normalization are one and
indivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of
peace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization
taken hostage and brought to a halt.
Israel makes no secret that normalization of its
relations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.
This means comprehensive political and economic relations,
and the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual
acceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a
body foreign to the region. Normalization must erase
forever the residue of this ideological negation.
Normalization is the indispensable cement for keeping
together the edifice of peace.
One of our immediate goals is the resumption of
negotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid
principles, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two
countries. We recognize Syria’s important role in the
establishment of lasting peace in our region. From this
rostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume
negotiations.
As to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with
Lebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon
can be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and
the building of peace.
Egypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our
partners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have
always been engaged in all stages of the peace process.
Jordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the
building of peace in our region. A man of peace and
dialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively
supported the peace process and has provided a vital
guarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed
his complete support.
On the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,
the country of my birth and family roots, has always
walked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab
reconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King
Hassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-
Israeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his
essential role and breathe into peace the remarkable
inspiration of his solidarity.
I would like to pay tribute also to the active support
of Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania
have all helped to consolidate peace efforts.
The peace process has benefitted from the
considerable support of the co-sponsors, the United States
and Russia, and from the active and positive contribution
of the European Union and Norway and of Powers such
as Japan and Canada.
Once again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’s
irreversible commitment and determination to pursue the
path of peace.
Since the dawn of history our region has been a
meeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a
vibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the
crossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East
must, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this
place and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs
and Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to
regenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and
humanity.
Through international cooperation, Israel is sharing
with young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin
America to China, its achievements and assets in the
fields of agriculture, health and science.
We hope that the day will come when a regional
security system will be established in the Middle East to
provide a cooperative multilateral response to all security
problems. The advantage of this regional approach is that
it is based on direct negotiations between the States of the
region. The first stage is to build confidence, and
thereafter we must put arms control and disarmament
13


mechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the
establishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security
Working Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope
that in the future this framework will encompass all States
of the Middle East.
Israel’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set
ambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and
realistically. After peace and reconciliation have been
established among all the States of the region, Israel will
endeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as
ballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to
rigorous verification.
Negotiations to establish such a zone will commence
following the signing of bilateral peace accords between
Israel and all the countries of the region. In the meantime
Israel will implement confidence-building measures that
will increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make
a contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed
conflict.
We generally prefer regional security arrangements.
However, Israel is in favour of the implementation of
certain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control
and disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel
signed the Convention on conventional weapons and
adopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of
anti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty
against the use of chemical weapons and now the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will
consider ratification of that Treaty depending upon
developments in the region, particularly the adoption of that
Treaty by the major countries.
Israel has thus demonstrated its determination to be
involved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the
international community to prevent the spread of
conventional and non-conventional weapons.
Israel strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged
member of the family of nations represented in this
Organization. We note with regret and deep disappointment
that the question of our membership in a regional group has
still not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right
available to all States Members of the United Nations to
participate on an equal footing in all its activities. This
impairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations
under the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this
injustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able
to act within this Organization on the same footing as all
other Member States.
It is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name
is invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to
conclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great
religions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and
ensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression
for all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality
to which Israel has made a profound contribution.
Jerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,
has throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the
summit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in
ancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the
capital of any country other than Israel.
Rarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied
the right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people
of peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,
has returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:
Jerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving
devotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of
peace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shall
tirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.




"
5,1997,"ISR_prev_1998","I would like to begin by
congratulating the President on his unanimous election to
preside over the fifty-second session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this
session the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations
closer to each other and in finding ways to address the
challenges that face all countries and nations, north and
south, east and west.
I also wish to congratulate his predecessor,
Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in
which he carried out his duties.
We mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the
peace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,
Menachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar
Sadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their
courageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first
peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.
Throughout their entire history, the people of Israel
have aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant
call for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any
effort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,
a partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek
channels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.
In recent years, since 1991, after the principles for
negotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at
Madrid, we have achieved a number of important
advances with the establishment of full peace between
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the
signing of interim accords with the Palestinians.
Nevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and
negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and
Lebanon still lie ahead of us.
Immediately after the last elections, the Government
of Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the
Oslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the
past year we have spared no effort to implement those
accords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood
of the entire process has been undermined as a result of
the failure of the Palestinians to carry out their
commitments according to the agreements they have
signed.
In the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we
have endured many tests and have suffered ongoing
terrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration
for peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the
shedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,
women and children cut down by barbaric terrorist
attacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over
the loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has
not been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of
Israel.
The citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves
great risks for peace, but there is none among them who
is willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being
demanded in the name of peace. We must break this
tragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in
confronting the terror that trust will be re-established and
the doubts regarding intentions be removed.
As I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of
this Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for
peace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both
right and left are united in this quest.
If trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity
is honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We
have already proved our willingness to do so, through our
decisions and actions since taking office and in the
signing and implementation of the Hebron agreement in
all its aspects.
Peace cannot live side by side with continued
incitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in
essence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of
25


violence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the
honouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.
These principles apply throughout the world and must
apply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel
tracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a
second track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues
unimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct
challenge and affront to the very concept of peace.
Terror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not
a spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen
terrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of
innocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare
organizations, while under this cover they contribute to the
preparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.
Terror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any
moment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie
in its path.
Those who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill
Israelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be
accepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It
must be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must
be fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its
constant threat.
The words of the President of the United States and of
the Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few
days ago are important and should guide us all in this
matter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this
very rostrum:
“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable
political act.” [See Official Records of the General
Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th
meeting]
Thus, the international community bears the responsibility
for ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,
recognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.
In the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority
and Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the
Palestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this
commitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again
one year ago at the Washington summit and again in the
Hebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been
proved that this commitment has not been upheld as
required, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.
Israel stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian
Authority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against
terror. The Authority must act jointly and in full
cooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We
seek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the
implementation of signed agreements. The fight against
terror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian
interest.
In response to the repeated crises in the process
caused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live
up to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of
conduct for relations between us. This code should
include, first, the rejection of violence as a means for
achieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the
framework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain
from attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto
the international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of
permanent channels of communication, including in times
of crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call
to violence and jihad, and their replacement with the
language of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,
the advancement and encouragement of normalization and
support for regional activities.
The purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate
uninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to
create an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond
to the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe
that the adoption of the above principles will allow us to
overcome the present crisis and help in preventing future
ones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game
will also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders
and greater confidence between the peoples.
In the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the
United States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has
been reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace
process to its proper track. We have been conducting
intensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the
United States, both in Washington and here, with a view
to resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to
reach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.
Israel values and appreciates the action of the United
States Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts
to extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to
bring the parties closer together and to ensure the success
of the negotiations. We are fully committed to these
efforts.

Israel reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated
negotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on
permanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in
which the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and
the way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended
to hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to
delay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the
Palestinian Authority.
The international community can play an important
role in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which
will make it possible for us to resolve our differences
through direct negotiations. It is only through direct
negotiations that we can bring this process to a successful
conclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or
pressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the
dispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the
United Nations and other international forums only serve to
create unnecessary obstacles and to make already
entrenched positions more rigid.
The comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be
achieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and
Lebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and
agreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to
resolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to
find in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for
a just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in
favour of peace — the “peace of the brave”, as claimed by
its leadership — then we must explore together every
possible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing
the talks between us.
Israel cannot accept the continued violence and terror
on its northern border. The terrorist activities of
organizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha
rockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the
threat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.
There is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.
We wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon
acting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that
operate from its territory.
If we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only
with agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means
normalization, open borders, freedom of movement,
commerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire
region. These are the soul and essence of peace.
Normalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.
The decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab
League at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week
ago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for
peace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to
prevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of
existing relations with it, to close liaison and interests
offices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to
reactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a
boycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which
is reversing the process.
The ongoing and intentional freeze of the
multilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the
entrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant
and should serve as a platform and incentive for building
peace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral
channels alike and not make one conditional upon the
other, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road
to peace. The question mark hanging over the regional
economic conference scheduled to take place later this
year in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative
drive.
The countries of the Middle East that are party to
the peace effort have a common interest in regional
stability and the advancement of prosperity and well-
being for all the nations of the region. We face together
the growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding
desert. We are also facing dangers from within our region
that threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of
various nations and to plunge the entire region into
violence, war and bloodshed.
It was only a few years ago that the entire world
was forced into forming a coalition to combat an
aggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring
country and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face
new and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of
recent experience have not been learned and many
countries turn a blind eye to the threat.
The leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms
that threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.
Yet the international community continues to remain deaf
and refuses to speak out against Iran's policies,
declarations and actions.
Iran's efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire
operational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds
represent the greatest threat to security and stability in the
Middle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran's
weapons programme extend far beyond the geographical
confines of our region. They threaten the security of other
27


members of the international community and their interests.
Israel reiterates its call to the members of the
international family of nations — and at their head the
United States, Russia and the members of the European
Union and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —
to exercise the full weight of their influence and to take
concrete steps to prevent this development, which
represents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.
After the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties
between Israel and every country of the region, it will be
possible to create a regional security system that would
provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of
security problems in the Middle East, including a mutually
and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These
are our goals and we must act to achieve them.
Israel is an active and responsible member of the
family of nations represented in this body. However, 50
years after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November
1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the
State of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this
Organization.
We attach great importance to the fundamental reform
of the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of
other United Nations Member countries that believe that the
Organization urgently requires greater efficiency and a
redirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its
truly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced
that no reform can be completed so long as the question of
Israel's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.
We call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.
Much to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an
intensification of the political campaign waged against
Israel at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes
the peace process and further undermines confidence
between the parties. We call upon the Member States to
refrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The
time has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of
resolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and
to contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive
to direct negotiations between the parties.
As part of Israel's international and regional
commitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in
cooperative programmes with many countries, with which
we share the experience and knowledge we have acquired
in various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its
international cooperation programme and to assisting
various peoples to address the challenges of development
and the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.
Over more than three decades, tens of thousands of
trainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their
own countries within the framework of Israel's
cooperation and assistance programme in the fields of
education, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and
leadership. We are especially proud of the participation in
recent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst
them Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of
goodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the
message and the great hope of human well-being. As in
the words of the prophet:
“Each shall help his neighbour and make him
strong”.
This year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the
world marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years
ago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in
its ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our
2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we
would renew our national life in the land of our
forefathers, the land of Israel.
It is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this
aspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its
land. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its
ancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant
and democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,
research and industry.
For the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure
Israel's security and independence, while always seeking
peace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty
years on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.
This week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish
new year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye
towards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the
peace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of
hope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the
shofar is accompanied by the prayer:
“may the year and its troubles pass and a new year
and its blessings begin”.




"
5,1971,"ISR_prev_1998","60.	 Mr. President, you come to the leadership of the General Assembly at a time when eastern Asia stands in the center of international concern. It is in that region alone that war still rages day by day. It is there that a burden of suffering, unparalleled elsewhere, weighs heavily on the conscience of mankind. And it is to Asia that our eyes will turn when we come to take decisions on the future of this Organization and the principles underlying its structure.
61.	It is right at such a time that an Asian statesman of high capacity and repute should preside over our deliberations. Israel wishes you success and pledges itself to your support. You will be fortified by the high example of your eminent predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, and by the experience and patient skill of the Secretary-General, who is completing a full decade of service to the international cause.
62.	Last year the United Nations marked its twenty-fifth anniversary by an act of celebration. I suggested then that the occasion could have been more wisely used for scrutiny and self-criticism (1851st meeting]. There is a manifest decline in the influence of the General Assembly on the main issues affecting human welfare and destiny. Its resonance has diminished. The central currents of international life and policy flow outside its walls. The frustration arises, not so much from defects in the Organization's work, as from discord and contention amongst the Powers. Yet there are some causes which lie within our capacity of correction. I shall mention one.
63.	In the work of the United Nations there is a strong accent on public controversy and a relative neglect of private conciliation. A report by the Secretary-General 11 years ago contained a plea to give greater emphasis to the United Nations as an instrument for negotiation of settlements as distinct from this world debate of issues. The advice was not heeded. Debate, not negotiation, still dominates the United Nations practice. Resolutions are adopted in great numbers, but their texts bear witness to the parliamentary advantages of fragmentation rather than to a balanced view of rights or realities.
64.	For example: in a dispute in the Middle East between two parties one of which has a single vote and the other 16 or, in practice 40, the preordained triumph of automatic majorities has no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory. The same is true of the Security Council, a third of whose members have their diplomatic relations and their ethnic or sentimental predilections exclusively on one side.
65.	This difficulty would not exist if the organs of the United Nations would regard it as their main function to seek consensus which would include the interested parties. They would be better employed in encouraging agreement between the parties at issue, than in sharpening controversy between them by attempts at adjudication. In short, the United Nations should aspire to a diplomatic rather than to a parliamentary role. The test of achievement should be not how many resolutions we have voted but how many solutions we have advanced.
66.	And, indeed, wherever free, direct negotiation has taken place across the world in the past year there has been fruitful issue. There have been the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, based, as Mr. Gromyko significantly told us, ""on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers"" [1942nd meeting, para. 101]. He was referring to the frontiers established after the war by negotiation and agreement. There has been the four-Power agreement on Berlin where, as Mr. Gromyko again correctly said, it is now up to the two parties directly concerned ""to complete the negotiations between them"" [ibid., para. 98]. There has been the normalization of relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been direct contact between the United States and the People's Republic of China, to be followed at an early date by a meeting at the highest level of responsibility. The Paris talks on Viet-Nam, with the direct participation of all the parties at issue, have been accompanied by a constant de-escalation of the fighting. There is grave tension between India and Pakistan, as is evident from the general debate here earlier this week; but the two Governments have direct relations which they ca« apply to the solution of their differences. Many hearts are heavy at the reports coming from the boundary between Ireland and
Northern Ireland; but there is also news that the heads of Government concerned have met each other and agreed on a process of political reconciliation. In Washington, agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are being signed today for modernizing the ""hot line"" and strengthening safeguards against accidental war.
67.	Is there no lesson to be drawn from the settlements reached and attempted this year? Surely they show that the air is alive with a spirit of innovation. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to be an organic part of our generation's life are now yielding to a strong impulse for peaceful settlement. Above all we are learning lessons about the immense importance of communication. Time and again the decision of Governments to abandon their cold separation and make contact with each other develops from a procedural advance into a change of substantive positions and thence into binding agreements. The central themes of international life in 1971 are direct contact, the abandonment of traditional conflicts, and flexible, pragmatic negotiation.
68.	There is also a move away from dogmatic attachment to documents. If old formulas and texts have reached deadlock, new ones are sought. There is a particular recognition that after wars the need is to build new systems of relations and not to reproduce the conditions and situations out of which war erupted. This new empiricism affects the juridical domain as well. Governments which seriously seek peace do not hesitate to confer directly with Governments which they do not yet recognize and with which they have no legal relations,
69.	If there is frustration in the Middle East it is because our region is still the exception to all the positive rules which have been applied elsewhere. Whatever is tried successfully in other regions is avoided in the Middle East. Here alone there is still no contact between the parties at issue. Here alone the Governments which will have to live side by side with each other have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. Here alone we are often told that the only way to get peace is to restore the situations which erupted in war. Here alone it is said in many places that the resumption of an important peace mission is wholly dependent on a single memorandum on which there is deadlock, and that there is no room for any innovation or any versatility of formulas and techniques.
70.	It is true, despite these failures, that the situation in the Middle East today is less explosive than a year ago. The flow of events has not been backward. The cease-fire along the Suez Canal has been effective, with rare and isolated exceptions, for 14 months. Israel does not propose to bring it to an end and Egypt would achieve nothing by violating it. Indeed, the only certainty in the Middle East is that resumed hostilities would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The absence of fighting along the Suez Canal line has released the Middle East and the world from the daily prospect of escalation involving the Soviet forces which were irresponsibly introduced into the' region with the effect of aggravating and enlarging a local tension. There has been a sharp decline in the strength and prestige of the terrorist groups and the pirate organizations that loomed so large a year ago. There has been peaceful movement across open bridges into Israel and the administered territories of scores of thousands of Arabs from neighboring Arab countries which are officially ""at war"" with Israel. Thus new patterns of coexistence have grown up between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in daily life and work. Side by side with a violent and incendiary Arab rhetoric there seem to be here and there some beginnings of a greater realism in Arab thinking on the problem of Israel's sovereignty and Israel's deep roots in the life and history of the Middle East. Finally, there are three separate availabilities of good offices which, although not all in active course today, are mutually accepted by the parties: the Jarring mission; the good offices of the United States in pursuit of an agreement concerning the Suez Canal; and the intention of ten African Presidents to authorize four eminent heads of State to go to Jerusalem and Cairo on a mission of information and goodwill.
71.	Yet, with all these consolations the peace efforts are not sufficiently intense. The talks under Ambassador Jarring's auspices, which began in high promise in January, have been at a standstill since the end of February. An exchange of views and positions on a special Suez Canal agreement was inaugurated through the good offices of the United States in April. This effort is still underway, but its pace is slow. In discussing the obstacles to peace it would be easy, but sterile, to fall into recrimination. Nothing would be easier. One of the few things that all Members of the United Nations have in common is the ability to discuss each other's imperfections. Yet what mankind longs to hear is not how deadlocks arose, but how it is proposed to overcome them. The general debate will be well used if Middle Eastern States will give precise definition to what they are prepared to do in order to bring a peaceful settlement into view. All who seek an understanding of Israel's policies must come face to face with two elements in the national mood. There is a sharp preoccupation with security; and there is a vivid memory of the horror and dark peril from which we emerged four years ago.
72.	In reflecting on the theme of security, Israel cannot easily forget the immense loss and burden it has borne through the hostility directed against it for over two decades. Our danger, in 1967 was the climax, but not the whole story, of our predicament. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual survival. Israel's insistence on genuine and stable security takes particular depth from the hideous legacy of Jewish massacre in the European slaughter-house. No people in history has undergone an experience of such tragic depth and scope. And no other State has grown for 23 years amidst such a comprehensive effort to deny it every breath of life.
73.	In particular, Israel's mind preserves a permanent and,, unfading image of the danger and solitude from which it emerged in the summer of 1967. To forget or ignore these memories is to renounce all true understanding of the Middle Eastern reality today. It was only by exceptional vigilance and cruel sacrifice that we repelled a monstrous design that would have ended our people's historic journey and cast all Israel's life and achievement into the flames. Maritime blockade, terrorist incursions, military encirclement, declarations of overt war, a frenzied torrent of threats and a formal announcement from Cairo that the battle was joined for Israel's destruction all these came
together in cumulative assault,""We recall the outrageous silence and apathy with which the Security Council, between one adjournment and the next, calmly observed the only attempt in modern history to wipe a sovereign State off the map of the world. Mr. Gromyko indulges his sense of humour when he tells us that guarantees by the Security Council are among ""the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world"" [ibid.., para. 135], The truth has Iden and is that, largely as a result of Soviet policy, the Security Council for 20 years has refused to defend any Israeli right including the right not to have its citizens killed, its ports blockaded, its existence threatened. The policy of the Security Council has been to refuse to adopt any decision of which a single word is unpalatable to the Arab Governments. It has thus surrounded every assault on Israeli lives, Israeli rights and Israeli security with indulgence. At the highest point of tension and of Israel's danger in May 1967, with Israel blockaded and encircled on every side, with all mankind gripped by the apprehension of approaching war, the suggestion of the Soviet Union was that the Security Council should go home and refuse to discuss such an ""artificial"" matter as the declaration of active war and the formal imposition of a blockade against a Member State. It is largely because of Soviet policy that the Security Council cannot be a guarantor of any Israeli rights. And the future development in the composition of the Security Council, however essential for other reasons, is bound to emphasize its inability to guarantee or even to express an Israeli interest, whatever the majority of its members may think or say.
74.	There are few effective guarantees of peace beyond those inherent in the nature of the peace itself. The greatest danger is lest through lassitude of spirit or impatience or imprecision of diplomatic craftsmanship we again revert to fragile, false and ambiguous solutions, which carry in them the seed of future wars.
75.	But the work of peace, however complex, must be attempted. Israel's deepest aspiration is to take part in a new deployment of energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East. Accordingly I ask the crucial questions: Is the slow rhythm of the peace efforts inevitable? Can nothing be done or at least attempted to set some dialog in swifter motion? Do Israel's policies offer openings through which roads to peace can be discerned and actively explored? My answer is that if the Arab States, and especially Egypt, sincerely desire an honorable and lasting peace, there are many roads leading to that goal.
76.	The first road lies in a Suez Canal agreement. There are many reasons for giving priority to this at attempt. A sudden transition from a conflict of more than two decades to a total settlement has proved difficult. It may be more rational to expect progress by stages. Each stage would bring about a solution of a specific problem while opening the way to further agreements and thus to final peace.
77.	The Suez Canal sector calls urgently for disengagement. It is there that the regional tension is compounded by the military presence of a great Power. Disengagement of forces here is an urgent international interest.
78.	The President of Egypt proposed on 4 February an attempt to open the Suez Canal ahead of a total settlement.
Israel's Prime Minister responded on 9 February. Both Governments subsequently agreed that the United States should use its good offices to explore the prospect. We therefore have an agreed objective and an agreed modality. , We believe that the effort to bridge the gulf between the positions of the parties should be pursued in the general interest of peace. If agreement cannot be reached on such a clearly defined issue in which Egyptian advantage is so strong it would appear to be even more difficult to advance in one step towards an over-all settlement in which all the complex issues would Ml into place. But the contrary is also true. A concrete result in this matter will accelerate and inspire negotiation and agreements on other issues. The peace effort will acquire momentum. It will be surrounded for the first time by an air of confidence and promise.
79.	Having been invited to give its views on this matter, Israel developed a proposal that an arrangement be agreed upon with a view to the opening of the Suez Canal to be cleared and operated by Egypt. Israel would make a withdrawal of its forces from the water-line to an agreed distance. The fighting would not be resumed. Egypt would clear and open the Canal. It would be agreed that there be free passage for all ships and cargoes, including those of Israel. Effective and agreed supervision procedures would be established. Means of deterrence against the danger of violation of the agreement would be assured. The agreement would stand on its own feet, but it would not affect or annul the undertakings which the parties gave in August 1970 to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in conformity with his mandate under Security Council resolution 242(1967). The line to be held by Israeli forces in accordance with that Canal agreement would not be considered final. When agreement on a final boundary is reached in the framework of the peace settlement Israeli forces will withdraw to it.
80.	We hope that Egypt will give this proposal the detailed and careful consideration which seemed to be its intention in April. It represents far-reaching concessions on Israel's part. It involves a movement from the cease-fire line ahead of peace. It mitigates the accepted legitimate principle that no withdrawal need take place ahead of a contractual and mutually agreed peace. The prestige, benefits and revenues from the Canal, the possible return of three quarters of a million people who live near the Canal in peaceful times, as well as the crossing of the Canal by Egyptian civilian personnel, would all be Egyptian, not Israeli, gains. A new impetus would be given to the Jarring mission, which is now in abeyance. The undertakings which I have given refute the idoa that the Canal agreement would be the last word. On the contrary, its conclusion and observance would create a favorable channel for further agreements.
81.	It is true that neither Egypt nor Israel would attain its final objective in this interim framework, but Egypt's right to present its claims in the over-all peace negotiations would remain intact, as would Israel's freedom to present its own proposals and reservations.
82.	A second road to peace lies through the resumption of negotiations under Ambassado. Jarring's auspices. Israel agreed to resume these talks in January 1971 despite Egypt's refusal to rectify its violation of the missile- standstill agreement. At a meeting with the Prime Minister and myself in January, Ambassador Jarring was requested to communicate to the Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon a list of principles which, in our view, should be embodied in the peace agreements to be concluded and signed between Israel and each of the Arab Governments concerned. These principles were, at first, vehemently ""ejected by the Egyptian Government. Subsequently, on i 5 February, the Government of Egypt commented f A/8541, annex II] on an aide-memoir submitted a week before by Ambassador Jarring [A/8541, annex I], It did not accept Mr. Jarring's precise formulations on navigation in the Suez Canal, on the Straits of Tiran, nor indeed on the definition of the scope of withdrawal. But the Egyptian reply did contain an expression of readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that all the Egyptian terms for the agreement were met. One of these terms was the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip and all territories beyond the armistice line existing on 4 June 1967.
83.	In its reply on 26 February 1971 [A/8541, annex III] the Israel Government viewed favorably the expression by Egypt of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and reiterated that it was prepared for meaningful negotiation on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.
84.	Why then are the Jarring talks in abeyance? The reason is plain. The Security Council resolution, 242(1967), requires that the withdrawal and boundary clauses of the peace agreement, like all its other provisions, must be determined through agreement, which of course implies negotiation. Egypt declines to hold any dialog or negotiation whatever on this point. It lays down its own position as an ultimate condition to which Israel must submit before negotiation begins. Indeed it is not clear why negotiation would be needed at all if the Egyptian view has to be accepted in advance. In a recent declaration of which President Sadat was a signatory, three Arab Governments, including that of Egypt, reiterated that there can be no negotiation with Israel, no conciliation and no bargaining over the Palestinian issue. This is a more recent and presumably more authoritative statement of Egypt's policy than the one that Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Mr. Jarring six months ago. Together with other declarations in the same mood and spirit, it raises the question whether the February memorandum has the significance that we chose to attach to it at that time.
85.	But on one point alone the February communication from Cairo and the Damascus tripartite statement are one: they both rule out the free, precise and detailed negotiation of the ""boundary and withdrawal questions. Our policy is that, instead of cease-fire lines or armistice lines, we should establish secure, recognized and agreed boundaries as part of the peace-making process, and withdraw our armed forces to those boundaries once they are determined. It is important to break away from the temporary and unresolved territorial concepts which have prevailed since 1948 in order to develop for the first time a permanent structure of boundaries and security agreements.
86.	There is no need to be apologetic about the doctrine that peace boundaries may be different from armistice lines. The Arab Governments wrote into the 1949 Armistice Agreements a provision stating that the armistice lines are not the final boundaries and these must be worked out by agreement in the transition to peace. We are now embarked on that transition. Israel's size and strength are smaller than those of the European Powers which insisted on secure and agreed boundaries after the Second World War; but the right to negotiate boundaries that would release Israel from a chronic and desperate vulnerability belongs to it as to every other sovereign State. In this matter we are not in a position of juridical defense.
87.	I shall summarize under three headings the reasons and justifications which give Israel the right to have negotiation on boundaries and security arrangements. The first, as I have already pointed out, is the provisional character of the lines now held as well as those which existed before. Several years before the 1967 war the Deputy Foreign Minister of Egypt correctly said: ""There is no legal boundary between Israel and Egypt but only a line that was fixed in the pursuance of the Armistice Agreement.""
88.	On 31 May 1967 the representative of Jordan said in the Security Council:
""There is an Armistice Agreement. The Agreement did not fix boundaries; it fixed a demarcation line. The Agreement did not pass judgment on rights political, military or otherwise. Thus I know of no territory; I know of no boundary."" 
89.	A second and more contemporary reason in support of Israel's claim to a negotiation on withdrawal and boundaries lies in the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which has been accepted by some Arab States and by Israel and which is the constitutive document of the Jarring mission. That resolution was adopted after all attempts to require a withdrawal to the 4 June armistice lines had been defeated by vote or discarded for lack of support. The term ""secure and recognized boundaries"" was an innovation in the United Nations vocabulary. It first appeared in a United States draft resolution submitted on 7 November 1967 and later embodied in a United Kingdom draft  which was presented for unanimous vote. I must state with full solemnity and knowledge that Israel's adherence to the Security Council resolution and acceptance of the Jarring mission were secured on the most explicit understanding that the resolution offered an opportunity to negotiate agreements on boundaries and withdrawal. Secretary of State Rogers stated for the United States in October 1969:
""Those boundaries were armistice lines not final political borders. The rights, claims and positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were reserved by the Armistice Agreements. The Security Council resolution neither endorses nor precludes those armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.""
90.	In a public statement on 12 July 1970, Mr. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, declared that he had taken an active part in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). He added:
""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre- June 5 lines. The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""
91.	The United Kingdom Government, which sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967), put itself on record on 17 November 1969, when its Foreign Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, was asked:
""What is the British interpretation of the wording of the 1967 resolution? Does... it... mean that the Israelis should withdraw from all territories taken in the late war? ""
He replied:
""No, Sir. That is not the phrase used in the resolution. The resolution speaks of secure and recognized boundaries. Those words must be read concurrently with the statement on withdrawal."" 
A month later, on 9 December 1969, in the House of Commons he said:
""... There is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""?
I repeat: ""... the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""
92.	It was in the light of these clear undertakings that the Israel Government informed Mr. Jarring in August 1970 that it accepted the Security Council resolution 242 (1967) for implementation in all its parts and that on the establishment of a just and final peace in accordance with the resolution it would withdraw its forces from the cease-fire lines to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the negotiations.
93.	The political and juridical aspects of the questions to which I have referred are the expression^ a deeper, more concrete reality. Israel does not have a policy of expansion or annexation. In the negotiations on boundaries and withdrawals it will seek those modifications which are essential to ensure security and to prevent another war.
94.	ihe war of 1967 did not arise exclusively from the vulnerability of the armistice lines. But there is no doubt that some topographical and strategic situations were a permanent temptation to assault. If they are not corrected and adjusted Israel, on withdrawing from the cease-fire lines, would find itself again in a position of intolerable vulnerability. There could be no more horrifying error than to revert, through lack of precise and detailed negotiation, to a territorial structure and security balance capable of reproducing the peril which exploded four years ago.
95.	In the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai peninsula or even in most of it. But there are vital interests affecting security, peace and navigation which impel us to reserve the right to attempt in the peace negotiations to secure a contractual basis for such continued presence as is necessary to protect security and navigation. There are several juridical expressions and precedents for such an arrangement. Our emphasis is on practical security conditions, not on any particular juridical formula. The post-war map of the world is replete with instructive parallels. The peace treaties in Europe and Asia did not bring about a return to the exact military and territorial dispositions that existed before.
96.	Now Israel does not ask Egypt to accept any of its positions as a condition of negotiation. The proposal for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops to the previous positions is legitimate as an Egyptian proposal. It is equally legitimate for Israel to insist on an opportunity of free negotiation in which its own reservations and counter-proposals could be made. And our request from the world community is modest. We do not present specific Israeli proposals for endorsement by other Governments; we ask only that our right to negotiate the issues vital to our future, to our peace and to our security, should not be cut off in advance.
97.	Our position, then, is this: We have taken note of the Egyptian proposal on withdrawal. Israel would withdraw its armed forces from the Israel-United Arab Republic ceasefire line to the secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in the peace agreement. Now that both parties have presented their basic positions, they should pursue their negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior condition to cover all the points I listed in their respective documents with a view to concluding a peace agreement. I continue to adhere to the view which I expressed at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly in October 1968 that
""It is possible to work out a boundary settlement compatible with the security of Israel and the honor of
Arab States	The majority of the United Nations have
recognized that the only durable and reasonable solutions are agreed solutions serving the common interests of our peoples. The new peace structure in the Middle East, including the secure and recognized boundaries, must be built by Arab and Israeli hands"" [1686th meeting, para. 111].
Thus if Egypt will present its position for negotiation without the unprecedented request for Israel's acceptance of it in advance, we shall be ready for detailed and concrete negotiation on all the matters mentioned in the Egyptian memorandum of 15 February and the Israeli document of 26 February,
98.	Effective and versatile conciliation must include a capacity to move from one direction to another in a tireless pursuit of peace. In March 1968, Ambassador Jarring suggested a formula for the convening of meetings between the parties in Nicosia on the basis of an agreed term of reference. Egypt rejected that proposal. Those concerned with the conciliation effort did not say that the mission had to be held in suspense until Egypt gave a positive reply to something which its policy did not then allow it to endorse. It would be wrong now to affirm that such a vital objective as the establishment of a negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt will never be possible except on the basis of a working paper which did not happen to secure the agreement of the parties. Egyptian-Israeli peace is too great a cause to be tied and tethered for all time to a single optional memorandum. If Egypt will agree to pursue negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior conditions on all the points listed in the Israeli and Egyptian memoranda of February 1971, this road to meaningful negotiation will lie open,
99.	There are other roads to peace. The Suez Canal agreement and the discussion of an over-all settlement are not the only options available for negotiation. The problem of refugees requires a broad acceptance of regional and international responsibility. We have therefore proposed the convening of a conference of Middle Eastern States, together with Governments which have contributed to refugee relief and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in order to chart a five-year plan for the solution of the refugee problem and the integration of refugees into productive life.
100.	This problem would now be considered against the background of some alleviating developments in recent months. There is a growing disillusion with the irredentist pretensions of the terrorist groups and the air pirates. The dividing wall which once prevented all human contact between Israelis and Palestine Arabs is falling. It is true that this is due so far to Israeli initiative. Last year not a single Israeli set foot in any Arab land, but 110,000 Arabs from countries ""at war"" with Israel came into contact with Israel across the open Jordan bridges. An open frontier between Israel and its eastern neighbor similar to the community frontiers in Europe would do much to give human reality to a peace settlement, and indeed might help the settlement to be achieved.
101.	There is a fourth possibility. The problems of boundaries and security are usually considered to be the crux of the negotiation. But there are other unresolved matters in the memoranda presented by Egypt and Israel in February. At first sight there seems to be some proximity between the peace, non-aggression, recognition and navigation clauses suggested by the two Governments. On closer inspection the disparities are substantial, and could become crucial. We suggested in January and later in March that, it might be profitable to attempt to draft some of the clauses of the Egyptian-Israel treaty relating to the principles of peace. It is an accepted negotiating technique to begin with problems in which divergences are less broad and thus to create a favorable atmosphere in which to confront the more acute problems.
102.	There is a fifth road towards negotiating procedure and activity; it concerns the negotiating procedure, but its weight is intensively substantive and not at all procedural I have said that in the early months of 1968 Ambassador Jarring suggested meetings between the parties, under his auspices, in Nicosia, in accordance with a text setting out the terms of reference for the conferences. On 10 March 1968, Ambassador Jarring informed me that Egypt had rejected that proposal. As the Secretary-General's report of 4 January 1971 reveals, Dr. Jarring ""was informed of Israel's official acceptance, without conditions, of the text"". 
103.	Now that was the negative turning-point in the history of the Jarring mission. Since then it has been limited, through Egyptian insistence, to a bizarre procedure under which Israeli documents are presented to Ambassador Jarring, and by him to the Egyptian representative. If the Israel document contains the words ""for communication to the Government of Egypt"", the Egyptian representative refuses to take it into his h?nds; or if he has inadvertently accepted its delivery, he comes back to relinquish it with panic-stricken haste as if it were a hot coal. The Israel document is then divulged by the Egyptian representative to the press, accompanied by a burst of invective. Egyptian replies are published without any hint of an intention to communicate them to Israel. The Egyptian position is that Israel may not talk to Egypt directly, may not talk to Egypt indirectly and may not communicate anything to Egypt in writing.
104.	If no other method is available my Government will communicate its views to Egypt by whatever channel or technique is possible. But we cannot conceal our conviction that there is an element of farce in the idea that the word ""negotiation"" can honestly be applied to the extraordinary procedure followed so far. How can a Government which alleges that it wants a peace agreement with Israel refuse to negotiate the terms of that agreement by a rational method of contact? To say that one is prepared to enter into a peace agreement but not to meet or negotiate even under international chairmanship is to make a mockery of the international community. One thing is clear: No international agreement has been reached on any subject between any States at any time by the methods to which the Jarring mission has so far been confined through Egypt's insistence.
105.	I am convinced that the strongest chance of breaking out of the deadlock lies in a transition to a rational negotiating procedure. The hour is ripe. The gap between the parties is wide, but may not be impossible to bridge. Negotiation is the agent which would transform the potentiality into action.
106.	One of the most important things said about the Middle East in recent days is Sir Alec Douglas-Home's statement yesterday that ""distrust... of this depth ... cannot [easily] be removed by long-distance correspondence"" [1944th meeting, para. 98] and that ""those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog'' [ibid., para, 97], If all those who hold that view would express it with equal candor, an international movement in favor of abandoning the illusion of long- range correspondence would come to effective expression.
107.	There is no weight or value in. the argument that the Arab Governments would be negotiating from weakness if they accepted direct contact under international chairmanship. Their point of reference would be, not the military situation, but the political forum in which the Arab side would speak from a position of numerical and geographical predominance,
108.	I therefore propose to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Riad, that we take our guidance from the spirit which inspires the international life of our ags. Let us meet here this month under the auspices of the United States to discuss the details and! principles of a Suez Canal settlement; or under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jarring to discuss the establishment of peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of our respective memoranda of February 1971. Let us break out of devious procedures and sterile polemics into a new vision and a new hope.
109.	In a recent statement the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, declared that he would sacrifice a million men to achieve a military victory. What he and we should be considering is how to ensure that the 33 million Egyptians, tin 3 million Israelis and the other millions in the Middle East are saved i.om sacrifice and preserved for the construction of a peaceful regional order. The task will not be served by war or by threats of renewed hostilities which command our vigilance but which are, in effect, an echo of ill-fated bombast in the recent past. Nor will our task be fulfilled by living out the rest of 1971 in ineffective debate or inflammatory resolutions. The Arab States may have enough voting strength to secure the adoption of virulent, unbalanced texts or to give a biased interpretation to the Security Council resolution, which would then cease to be an agreed documentary consensus available as a basis for the ultimate and inevitable negotiation. But what will it profit to gain an Assembly majority, but to lose Israel's adherence to a set of principles common to it and to neighboring States? The roads to peace do not have their starting point in war or in polemical debate. They branch out from one of the many avenues and by-ways of negotiation on which we shall meet Egypt when its choice is made and declared.
110.	This session could mark a recuperation in the career of ""the United Nations if the Organization made this the year of negotiation, the year of negotiation in all outstanding disputes. It has other tasks. The Second United Nations Development Decade can be saved from the frustrations of the First if the advanced countries turn aside from the perils of monetary war towards an expanding vocation in the development of emergent societies.
111.	And in the last resort this Organization will be judged according to the role it has played in defense of human welfare and dignity, The call of kinship and of dark memory will bring us to refer at appropriate stages in Committees and in the plenary meetings to two dramas of great intensity and pathos: the Jews of the Soviet Union, of whom some have reached us but of whom the great majority are still restrained from the expression of their cultural identity and their national hope; and the captive remnants of helpless Jews in Arab lands, especially in Syria, whose anguished voice cries out for liberation from terror and despair. This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit. It may be bearing within itself the seed of a universal order in which men will come together to save their environment from pollution, their society from disruption, their economy from decline, their life from the stress and grip of violence. There is no room for fatalistic despair. There is still time for men and nations to be, inspired by a new and spacious vision and to invest their thought and labour in defence of the ""common heritage of mankind"".



"
5,1999,"ISR_post_1998","The fifty-fourth session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations takes place
at a time marking humanity's crossing into the next
millennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain of
tumultuous events that have reshaped the map of the
family of nations.
12


The United Nations was born against the backdrop of
the destruction and desolation of the Second World War,
the most bitter, deadly and inhumane war known to
mankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths of
evil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization and
will be recalled in history as a nightmare in which man
created the devil, who wreaked devastation, destruction,
terror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken by
the Allied forces against the Nazi monster, and the creation
of the United Nations in April 1945, on the verge of the
defeat of the forces of destruction, was an act that marked
the return of humanity to its senses, to salvage the future of
mankind.
In this month when we mark 60 years since the
outbreak of the most horrible of wars, we are strengthened
more than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in the
necessity of the United Nations and of its activities
throughout the world. The various agencies of the United
Nations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; to
supply the needy with food and nourishment; to build
bridges between cultures; to promote education and
overcome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugees
and displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters,
whether natural or man-made.
The soldiers of the United Nations forces are the true
peacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from all
the nations of the world. At times they risk their lives in
areas riddled with conflict and violence around the world,
whether their United Nations mandate is to make peace or
to be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions,
important as they may be to the policy makers and shapers
of international relations, have no meaning to the individual
United Nations soldier, posted far from his country, who
brings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy,
suffering and violence.
After many centuries of violence and war, of
enslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderous
ideologies, after decades of cold war and polarized world
alliances of the East and the West, the human race is now
making great strides down the paths of peace and
reconciliation. Before our very eyes, a process is
enveloping the world, signalling hope for the future.
Mankind is adopting a new path, the path of the prophet
Isaiah, who as far back as 2,600 years ago prophesied that
the day would come when
“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)
This prophecy — which has been adopted by the
United Nations as a source of hope, as the symbol of the
victory of the good in human beings over evil — should
serve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for all
who cherish peace around the world and for their
representatives gathered here today.
The world has become more open. Satellites, the
Internet and telecommunications networks shorten
geographical and cultural distances. The political and
ideological blocs of the past have disintegrated, and the
walls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants and
dictators who built them. They are being replaced by new
blocs, some of which are in the process of being created
where development and prosperity reign. I hope and
believe that these beneficial transformations will also
occur in the Middle East.
In our region, too, the light of hope has been
rekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process,
the objective of which is to reach peace between States
and reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reach
a comprehensive peace with its neighbours, a peace of
harmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merely
political or strategic peace. In our eyes, the absence of
war is not the peace we aspire to achieve.
May I be allowed to emphasize once again that
peace means a culture of peace; peace means no more
threats of violence, whether implied or categorical; peace
entails the end of boycotts, the end of contempt and
defamation, the end of incitement and confrontation...
peace is also a language of peace: it is the way leaders
address their nations, teachers teach their students and
religious leaders inspire their followers.
At a time when various kinds of religious extremism
are rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom and
human freedom, it is essential that inter-faith dialogue be
strengthened and that the religions be manifested in their
enlightened forms, which sanctify tolerance and
coexistence.
On the way to achieving peace in our region, we
often find ourselves confronted with contradictory
realities. Parallel to the political process, our negotiating
partners are conducting a constant political war against
Israel in various international forums, including from the
podium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent
13


with the peace process and is intolerable, as are the extreme
decisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. These
decisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace, as
expressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
We hoped for and expected a different atmosphere,
one that would complement the impetus initiated by the
new Government in Israel. We have been saddened to
witness events that undermine the essence of peace. These
events can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.
Engaging in a peace process, on the one hand, and
maintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions, on the
other, raises some serious concerns about our negotiating
partners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace of
normalization with open borders, or is it only one of
temporary initial recognition? Will our relations with the
Gulf and Maghreb countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia,
Mauritania, Qatar and Oman, be allowed to expand and
develop? Or will these relations remain hostage to mood
swings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations or
whenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts about
these cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light of
the heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking upon
itself in this process.
Three weeks ago, on 4 September, Israel and the
Palestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum, which for the first time creates a direct,
chronological, political and conceptual link between the
Interim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13
September, the final status talks were renewed between
Israelis and Palestinians.
We are determined to reach a framework agreement
that will form the basis of the final status agreement by
February 2000, as stated and agreed upon in the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will select
the issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.
The topics at hand are known, as are the differing vantage
points and positions of each side. The differences can be
resolved only by direct negotiations.
Regarding the final status, I wish to affirm from this
podium that when we refer to political separation as one of
the prime concepts of the permanent settlement, we are also
saying that, for the benefit of both sides, we should not
necessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in the
various spheres of living.
From Israel’s perspective, there is no competition and
never has been any between the different negotiating tracks.
Israel also aspires to reach peace with Syria, our
neighbour to the north. This is, after all, in the higher
common interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r ,
along with these common interests, the following point
must be made clear: A democratic country like Israel
cannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks that
requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as
dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the
opposing side.
We must maintain the momentum of good will so
that we can face our children, Syrian and Israeli alike,
with a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:
We tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon the
leaders of Syria, in view of what we have gone through
together, to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetings
and discussion are not political sacrifices — they are
basic necessities.
On the road to a comprehensive peace, we wish to
see Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomaly
which has developed in its territory must come to an end.
We have never had nor do we have now any territorial
claims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and only
interest is to guarantee the safety and security of our
citizens. I must say that, regrettably, the Government of
Lebanon has for many years failed to enforce its
sovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarm
Hezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and that
Israel, within the framework of an agreement, will be able
to leave the southern part of Lebanon.
Nevertheless, with that as our ambition, I wish to
emphasize that we will not be held hostage much longer
on this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We will
make our own independent decisions, as we see fit, in
order to ensure our protection and our vital interests,
taking all options under consideration.
A reconciliation between Israel and its neighbours
must extend the promise that all the peoples of the region
may reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must not
be viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcome
of peaceful coexistence, normalization is not in the
service of one particular party. It is in the interests of all
the nations of the region.
We hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early as
this year. There is a need for close cooperation in
regional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendous
potential. In order to fully realize this potential, we must
establish a mechanism of true cooperation among the
14


States of the region. This cooperation would clearly be to
the benefit of all of us in the region.
The scarcity of water in our region, which will only
get worse, may impose a new way of life on the inhabitants
of the Middle East in the coming years. Israel is
anticipating this problem and preparing for it, but in this
case, as in others, cooperation in the region is essential and
will benefit all sides.
The working groups of the multilateral tracks
undertook various assignments of primary importance.
Unfortunately, their activities have been frozen for
irrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Any
delay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peace
process and delay the aid packages so essential to the
peoples of the region. Throughout this important process,
on the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike, we are
accompanied by the international community. First and
foremost was the United States of America, along with the
Russian Federation, the European Union, Canada, Norway,
Japan, China and other countries and organizations that
have assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributions
earn them special commendation from this rostrum.
Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking
down the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in our
region. Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as
renewing the multilateral tracks, are essential to furthering
the common objectives of the nations in our region. T h e
relations between Israel and Jordan are an example of
appropriate and favourable relations between neighbouring
countries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations
between the two nations in the economic, social and
political realms.
As we march further along the difficult path of
making peace, we look back with sorrow and sadness as we
remember the pioneers who broke new ground and are no
longer with us today: the late Menachem Begin, Anwar
Saddat, Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein and King Hassan II
of Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us to
continue to work towards completing their enterprise of
peacemaking.
We cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region is
neither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiate
the peace process, we remain aware of the threats and
dangers directed against us, threatening the stability of the
entire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism, on the
one hand, and of the potential use of weapons of mass
destruction, on the other, threatens the peace, stability and
future of the entire region. This threat is not just an
element of academic debates in the study of international
relations, but a harsh reality which we must all face.
From this international platform, I call for a halt to
all technological, scientific and other kinds of assistance
to countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons,
while threatening the existence of the State of Israel and
the region as a whole.
The Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadership
lacking reason and stability poses a threat to all the
countries in the region and to the world at large. The
monitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must be
immediately resumed. That is the obligation of the
international community so long as the Iraqi regime seeks
non-conventional weapons and threatens the region. The
United Nations is the largest, most authoritative and most
recognized international body. It should therefore be the
one to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbing
this danger.
Terrorism is an additional strategic enemy and we
cannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat not
only to Israel, but to many other nations across the world
as well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. There
can be no coexistence with terror, either in the context of
the negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours,
or in the broader regional context. Anyone who believes
that terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated is
mistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. A
synthesized, coordinated and unrelenting approach must
be adopted against it.
Here, in this building of stone and glass, reflecting
the current image of our world today with its points of
light and shadows of darkness, counterparts and enemies
meet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum for
discussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way to
resolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogue
and common language are the tools of diplomacy, the raw
material for the creation of a new reality and the
foundation for a stable and safer society.
It was here in the General Assembly, at the
beginning of the decade, that I first met with my Chinese
counterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation between
our two countries, we endeavoured to re-establish
diplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was also
here that we laid the groundwork for establishing ties
with the former Soviet Union, as well as with India,
Nigeria and other States. These are only a few examples
15


demonstrating the possibility in this arena for building a
bridge between nations and States.
As a nation that experienced great difficulties,
overcome only by accelerated development efforts, the State
of Israel takes part in the international effort to aid others
and share knowledge, experience and technology,
experience which it has accumulated in various fields. The
nation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharing
and identifying with the world at large.
Through the Division for International Cooperation
within the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel maintains ongoing
projects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. We
have demonstration units and we are conducting research.
For example, a special medical centre was recently
established in Mauritania and serves the many citizens of
that State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly,
Israel invests great efforts and resources in training
professionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary for
meeting the various challenges that engage many parts of
the world.
In the more than 40 years since its inception, the
Division for International Cooperation has trained more
than 70,000 trainees from more than 120 countries, who
have come to Israel and attended its training courses in the
areas of agriculture, water resources, health and medicine,
science, education and others.
In 1998 alone, some 155 courses were held in Israel
on a variety of topics, with the participation of more than
4,000 trainees. Gladly, I can report that many of the
trainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820
Palestinians participated in these courses over the past year,
thereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace which
have been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In the
same year, Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60
different countries, with the participation of over 7,000
trainees. I am proud to point out that in many of the
countries to which we sent Israeli experts, the local
personnel managed to translate our goodwill into positive
results on the ground, to the benefit of their people and
their land.
Because of the reputation it has acquired, the Division
for International Cooperation is also one of the central
addresses in Israel to which people can turn in times of
disaster around the world. We have recently witnessed just
how essential such assistance can be in times of natural
disasters. Israel has always responded favourably to
requests for aid and relief, regardless of the political
context or the state of diplomatic relations.
We wish to support and commend the United States
of America, our friend and ally, an inspiration to us all in
its efforts to promote the values of cooperation among
nations. This is also the time to express our appreciation
to the United States for its intensive efforts to bring true
peace to the Middle East.
Even today in the United States we have witnessed
again a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case at
hand is the threat to declare a boycott against the
American company Disney, because the company dared
to allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibition
celebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats and
the use by certain Arab States of this anachronistic
device. It has no place here or anywhere else in the
world.
Over thousands of years, since the time of biblical
King David, the builder of Jerusalem, until the present
day, Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any other
nation in the world besides the nation of Israel, the
Jewish people. Even after our forced exile from the land
of Israel, we continued, generation after generation, to
stay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem was
carried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.
In our wanderings, in the East and in the West, in
the African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia, from
the golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition,
during the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to the
charred ashes of the Holocaust, throughout all the above
the eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directed
toward Jerusalem. Year after year, from father to son, the
anthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been “Next
Year in Jerusalem”.
With the passing of those previous generations and
exiles, we have had the privilege of being deemed worthy
to return to Jerusalem, to rebuild the ruins, to rededicate
the city as a centre radiating with beauty, open to all
followers of all religions, as the poet has said, where
freedom of all religions is a fact of life.
It is so upsetting then that even today, 51 years since
the independence of the State of Israel, there are still
those who would deny our natural right to decide the
location of our capital, a natural right given to every
nation in the world. From Jerusalem, the city of David, I
will quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem,
16


in words which transcends the limits of time and retains
their meaning in every generation:
“Our feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmly
together.” (The Holy Bible, Psalm 122:2-3)
Today, as before, from this podium we declare to the
entire world, to our friends and people and those who are
distant from us: Jerusalem, unified under Israeli
sovereignty, is and will remain forever the capital of Israel.

"
5,1979,"ISR_prev_1998","161.	Mr, President, please accept my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide the work of the Assembly efficiently and fairly.
162.	I would also like to express our appreciation to the President of the last session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Lievano of Colombia.
163.	It is my pleasure to congratulate Saint Lucia on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
164.	As we reflect on the development of the United Nations throughout the past year, we find the spectacle far from encouraging. The fundamental obstacle to the Organization's work is the selectivity which has been forced upon it by an automatic majority of the membership, which is far from impartial and prefers expediency to principles. The United Nations specialized agencies have suffered badly from this. Organs like UNESCO, WHO, the ILO and others have been severely affected by heavy politicization which has influenced their functioning. Instead of dedicating themselves solely to their specific fields in the service of mankind, they have been reduced to forums of political one-sidedness.
165.	There must be a return to the United Nations Charter. Consultation and agreement should be restored to their primary place. In particular, the specialized agencies must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they have been dragged, so that they may devote themselves to the economic, social, humanitarian, scientific and technological tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform so well when permitted to do so.
166.	There has been little improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Even though the number of exit visas for Soviet Jews has increased recently, the gap between the number of Jews applying for exit visas and those granted them is growing, while an even larger number of Soviet Jews have been denied the fundamental right to emigrate—a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki Declaration. Those Jews who do insist on their rights are subjected to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment and, in some cases, to arrest and imprisonment. We have taken note of the fact that seven Jewish prisoners were released a few months ago. However, we are particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences imposed on other Jews whose only crime is their desire to re-join their families in Israel—Iosif Begun, Boris Kalendarov, Iosif Mendelevich, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Simon Shnirman, Vladimir Slepak, Aleksandr Vilic and Amner Zavurov. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and permit everyone who seeks to emigrate to Israel and join his people and his family to do so.
167.	We cannot be silent in the face of the rising incitement against the State of Israel and the Jewish people, its religion, culture and national movement, as manifested day by day in the official Soviet media. In this regard, it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their religion and culture. We appeal to the Soviet Union to allow Jewish religion and culture to be practised and expressed freely, and to put an end to anti-Jewish propaganda.
168.	We also deeply regret that the Government of Syria continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and to be reunited with their relatives living in other lands. We appeal to the Syrian Government to change this policy.
169.	The past year witnessed a historic break-through in the Middle East. In March, Israel and Egypt signed the first ever Israel-Arab peace treaty. President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel concluded that Treaty after intense negotiations, which lasted a year and a half and which demanded great leadership and courage. Israel wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States of America and to its President, Mr. Jimmy Carter, personally for the vital role which they played in bringing about this historic achievement, which has created a new reality in our region.
170.	Let me recall here that Israel has throughout the first 30 years of its independence constantly extended its hand to its neighbours in the search for peace. This found expression on the very first day of the establishment of our State, in the Israel Declaration of Independence of 14 May 1948. Let me add specifically that as early as in the summer of 1967, very shortly after the six-day war, Israel had taken the initiative and offered to sign a treaty of peace with Egypt, declaring its readiness to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egyptian sovereignty in the context of a peace treaty. This Israeli proposal was rejected, and the answer given by Egypt at the time was: ""No negotiation, no recognition and no peace with Israel: what was taken by force will be taken back by force."" This year, however, has seen the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. After a generation of continued warfare, the realization of a dream begins.
171.	The Treaty of Peace, which, as stated in its preamble, is ""an important step in the search for comprehensive peace in the area,"" has provided for a role in its implementation to be fulfilled by the United Nations. United Nations forces and observers were called upon to carry out functions in order to see that the peace treaty was fully implemented. Ironically and paradoxically, that initiative taken by some States Members of the United Nations in the cause of peace was rejected by the United Nations. The Security Council was exposed to the threat of a Soviet veto, and the mandate of UNEF was not renewed, so that the Security Council in effect disassociated itself from the first positive and major step in the great effort to relieve the Middle East from the dangers of war.
172.	Although our assumption and hope that the United Nations would assist in the implementation of the Treaty of Peace have been disappointed, we will proceed along the path of peace. The attitude of the United Nations will not damage the peace process; but it will, no doubt, lower the prestige and even the moral stature of the United Nations, one of whose basic principles and purposes is, as stated by the Charter, to ""maintain international peace and security . . . and to bring about by peaceful means . . . settlement of international disputes. . . ''.
173.	As a result of the Treaty of Peace, the process of normalization in the relations between Egypt and Israel has already begun. We are confident that in the months ahead we shall make further progress in cementing new bonds of co-operation.
174.	The frequent visits and meetings of the leaders of both countries are also an expression of the common desire to promote understanding and closer personal relationships. The most recent—and most impressive—visit of President El-Sadat to Israel three weeks ago and the reception given him in the city of Haifa, where Jews and Arabs coexist in harmony and cooperation, indicated the deep feelings of all the population of Israel towards the era of peace and, we hope, left warm memories in the minds and hearts of our Egyptian guests.
175.	Over the past year the situation in Lebanon has become grave. The intervention of Syria has, in fact, plunged the northern part of that formerly prosperous country into a state of anarchy, and the Lebanese Government has become incapable of ruling and exercising its authority over all of its territory. The southern part of Lebanon has been, to a great extent, in the hands of the terrorist groups of the PLO, whose murderous activities have been a source of danger and harassment not only to Israel, but also to the Christian and Moslem Lebanese in that area.
176.	UNIFIL was established by Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978.
177.	Israel, having been compelled to act militarily against the PLO in southern Lebanon in a clear act of self-defence, agreed to withdraw its forces, provided that the new United Nations force would undertake to restore peace and security in the area and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the country.
178.	Unfortunately, the aim of restoring Lebanon's integrity has not been achieved, and the Lebanese Government is still incapable of exercising its sovereignty. PLO terrorist groups are still functioning all over Lebanon and, in quite a large number of cases, inside the area of United Nations units. In this region, which was free from any terrorist presence at the time of the Israeli withdrawal, there are now about 700 PLO terrorists, who are acting murderously through the lines of the United Nations Force against the people of Israel. The Force was supposed to act against this. The Secretary-General, in his initial report of 19 March 1978 spoke of the right of self-defence of the Force, including resistance by forceful means to attempts to prevent it from discharging its duties.
179.	In his report of 13 September 1978, the Secretary-General stated, among the guidelines and terms of reference of UNIFIL, that ""uniformed or armed personnel and military equipment are not allowed to enter the UNIFIL area of operation""."" However, there are too many cases in which the Force has in fact reconciled itself to the presence and activities of the terrorists in its own area. UNIFIL has not carried out its mandate and duties in this respect, despite the fact that its units have themselves suffered from terrorist activities and at least eight UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in these incidents. The presence and activities of the PLO terrorist groups in the region are in violation of the UNIFIL mandate, and it should be understood that Israel cannot be expected to sit back while terror is being unleashed against its population, no matter where in Lebanon these actions originate.
180- Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries ceased to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. No cause can justify terrorism. The issue is, therefore, a fundamental one for the international community, and the struggle against terrorism should continue until terrorism has been brought to an end.
181.	The PLO, by its very nature and actions, is a terrorist organization. Its true character is reflected in its so-called' 'Covenant"", which calls for the purging of the Zionist presence from Palestine. The same document denies the existence of the Jewish people and its unbroken historical ties with the land of Israel. It alleges that the establishment of the State of Israel is null and void and rejects outright any plans to settle the Middle East conflict by peaceful means.
182.	The PLO has not hesitated to try to translate its vicious doctrine into criminal deeds. It has conducted an unceasing campaign of terror aimed at the mass murder of innocent civilians in Israel. From June 1967 to date, over 640 people have been murdered and 3,300 others have been wounded in Israel by the PLO. It has also terrorized and intimidated Arabs prepared to negotiate peace with Israel, killing more than 350 Arabs and injuring almost 2,000 others.
183.	Given the PLO's character and aims, it was, in fact, recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process. No country can or should be expected to negotiate with a party which denies its very existence, aims at its destruction, and uses terror against its civilian population. On the other hand, careful provision was made in the Camp David agreements to include Palestinian Arab residents of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District in the peace process.
184.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East, Agreed at Camp David by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel, and witnessed by the President of the United States of America, refers positively and constructively to Palestinian Arab rights, as well as to the rights and security interests of the other parties. It is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which are the only agreed basis for peace negotiations in the Middle East. Any tampering with them can only gravely jeopardize the current peace process.
185.	This Framework agreement sees the solution of the question of the Palestinian Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District in terms of granting them full autonomy, for a transitional period of five years, before reaching an agreement on the final status of the area. For that reason, it was agreed to negotiate on a principle of self-government—exercised through an administrative council—for the Arab inhabitants of the areas in question.
186.	Moreover, in the preamble to this Framework, the signatories invited other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere to it as well. In the letter sent by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel to President Carter on 26 March 1979—the date of the signing of the peace treaty—they invited the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Join the negotiations.
187.	This Framework provides for negotiations on the transitional period of five years, and also for the subsequent negotiations on a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, in which the location of the boundaries dividing the two countries will be agreed. The option of creating a third State between Israel and Jordan is, therefore, not considered in the Camp David agreements.
188.	Thus, the objective of the negotiations being held now, based on the Camp David Framework, is the provision of full autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. The Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants. This Framework also specifies measures that will be taken to assure the security of Israel and its neighbours.
189.	The only way to keep the process of peace going on is for us to adhere strictly to the Camp David agreements in their letter and spirit, and I should like to assure this Assembly that this is the policy of Israel.
190.	Before concluding, let me say a few words about Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people.
191.	Jerusalem has known many foreign rulers during the course of its long history, but none of them regarded it as their capital. Only the Jewish people has always maintained it as the sole centre of its national and spiritual life. For thousands of years, Jews have prayed daily for their return to Jerusalem and, for the past century and a half, Jerusalem has had a continuous and uninterrupted Jewish majority.
192.	Jerusalem cannot be divided again by barbed wire and there can be no return to the repeated shooting at our civilians and the barbaric desecration of the Jewish quarter of the City, the Holy Places and cemeteries, as happened before 1967, when the eastern part of Jerusalem was under the occupation of Jordan. It is relevant to recall that, in grave violation of the 1949 Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement; Jordan prevented Jews from having access to their Holy Places and cultural institutions and tried to eliminate systematically every trace of Jerusalem's Jewish past. By contrast, as a result of Israel's policy of free access to all Holy Places, millions of Moslem and Christian tourists and pilgrims—in addition to Jewish visitors—have come to Jerusalem since 1967, and have prayed and worshipped freely at its mosques and churches.
193.	Jerusalem is now a city of coexistence between Jews and Arabs. At the same time, the Government of Israel is and has always been conscious of the fact that Jerusalem is of deep concern also to other faiths, and that its religious and cultural sites are precious to Christians and Moslems, as well as to Jews. There should be completely free access to all the holy shrines by believers of all religions, without any exception, completely protected and guaranteed by the law of the country, and those holy shrines should be administered by the respective representatives of the religions concerned, without any interference.
194.	The choice before the United Nations is clear. This Organization, whose Charter enjoins it to support the cause of international peace and security, must not submit to the designs of those who reject peace. Let the United Nations give peace its full support. Let the Governments of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judaea, Samaria and Gaza join the negotiations in order to achieve the noble goal of a real and durable comprehensive peace in our area."
5,1980,"ISR_prev_1998","Mr. President, at the outset I should like to express to you our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and the outstanding qualities that you have exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy ensure your ability to keep a firm grasp on the helm of the Assembly during this stormy period.
53.	Al the opening of this session a new State joined the ranks of the United Nations: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I should like to welcome it to the Organization and wish it all prosperity and success as an independent and sovereign Stale.
54,	To my very grout regret, it is not possible to express satisfaction at the condition of the United Nations today, cither in general or from the specific perspective of my country. Indeed, it is questionable whether there remains much similarity or correlation between the noble ideals, principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the United Nations and the reality prevailing in the Organization today. The founders of this Organization saw in their vision a forum and a framework for the achievement and maintenance of peace between nations after the horrific experience of the Second World War, a horror which they had experienced at first hand.
55.	Perhaps the most cynical expression of the gap between the original vision and the reality prevailing in the United Nations today has been the refusal of this Organization, ostensibly dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to adopt and encourage the Camp David accords' and the subsequent Peace Treaty, which brought to an end decades of hostilities between Israel and Egypt and raised the possibility of expanding the peace process to embrace all of Israel's neighbours. This Organization, whose principal purpose is the promotion of peace among nations, has thus betrayed its own raison d'etre by rejecting an historic step towards peace and by playing into the hands of the enemies of peace, the rejectionists and the warmongers.
56. This unhappy phenomenon is not confined to the General Assembly. Out of the 18 debates which have been conducted thus far during 1980 in the Security Council, nine were devoted to subjects involving my country. Is there anyone who seriously believes that half of the world's international problems today are connected with Israel? We need only glance at a map of our region, the Middle East—which is just one region of the world—to sec that it is riddled from length to breadth with countless conflicts between States, between ethnic minorities and between different religious groups. Virtually all those conflicts have a history and a dynamic of their own, totally divorced from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
57. By way of illustration. I need only mention the situation in Afghanistan and. of course, the full-scale war between Iran and Iraq—a worrying outbreak of hostilities which has wide-ranging implications. That war between two States ruled by extremist, irresponsible and trigger-happy regimes threatens both regional and international security by putting at risk much of the world's regular supply of oil, That war, a struggle between two Moslem States, demolishes, in our opinion, the naive and groundless belief that the world's oil supply is dependent on a pro-Arab solution to the dispute between Israel and its neighbours. It has become all too clear that the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will not provide any miracle cure for the region as a whole or eliminate the many other grave conflicts raging in it. The ability of the United Nations to work for an end to the bloodshed in Iraq and Iran will be a yardstick of the Organization's ability to continue to fulfil its role for the encouragement and maintenance of peace.
58.	Important tasks have been allotted to the United Nations. Besides its role in the preservation of international peace and security, it also has a vital role to play in other spheres which require our earnest attention, in particular through the specialized agencies established for various purposes. But even the specialized agencies have been gravely compromised by the plague of politicization. Business-like debates and deliberations in them have become increasingly difficult—if not all but impossible to conduct—to the grave detriment not only of the agencies themselves but also of those whom they were set up to serve.
59.	While I am bound to express deep regret at the condition of the United Nations today. I must also express the hope that all Members of the Organization which share our concern and feelings of responsibility for its future will intensify their efforts both to bring the United Nations back to the ideals of its founders and to channel the specialized agencies back to their specific areas of concern.
60.	Among the subjects which have rightly been given a prominent place in the agenda of the United Nations are the state of the world's economy and the relations between the industrialized and the developing nations. The convening of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly attests to this fact. Israel took part in that special session with the intention of making a constructive contribution to its work. We therefore share the disappointment over the results of that event, which were not adequate. We sincerely hope that in the near future the efforts to have a constructive dialogue rather than confrontation will be resumed, so that those whose needs are greatest will not suffer the most.
61.	Despite our small size and limited resources, we have for decades devoted far greater efforts than might have been expected to assisting nations of the third world in the development of their economies and societies. Israel has shared freely the know-how which it has developed, as well as its experience as a small State in an arid and subtropical region, which has enabled us to make great strides over a period of a few short years.
62.	The problems encountered by Israel in the course of its social and economic development are similar to the problems facing much of the developing world today. Many of the solutions worked out in Israel can be applied directly by others. Despite the disappointments which my country has experienced, Israel continues to have deep sympathy for the struggle of the developing countries to ameliorate and advance the condition of their peoples and economies. Israel stands ready to continue to give of its know-how and to take a vigorous and constructive part in the efforts of the international community in the spheres of health, social services, agriculture, development of new and renewable sources of energy, and in every other sphere to which we can contribute.
63.	From this rostrum I should like to give expression to the anguish of our Jewish brothers in various parts of the globe. There is. it would seem, no end to the pain of the Jew in history. The suffering and persecution continue even today. And we, the people of Israel, feel responsible for the lot of every Jew who suffers anywhere.
64.	In the last year additional harsh limitations have been imposed on Jews who seek to leave the Soviet Union and emigrate to the State of Israel. Those restrictions conflict with the most basic human and national rights of peoples, and we are in duty bound to echo the cries of the Jews in the Soviet Union and appeal to the Government of that country to remove the restrictions and facilitate the immigration of Jews to Israel.
65.	We must also express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed, and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic-human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds as hostages and which it prevents from leaving.
66.	The Jews of Iran have suffered painfully in recent months, and their situation is deteriorating from day to day. Many Jews have been thrown in gaol; others have been given the death sentence, in most cases on ""charges"" of contact with Israel. We know of the difficulties in dealing with the present regime in Iran, to which fundamental concepts of human rights and the norms of international relations seem foreign. But we hope that sight will not be lost of the situation of the Jews there who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of the minorities in that troubled land.
67.	Two years ago a development took place in the Middle East—a breakthrough which can appropriately be called historic. After serious negotiations between the parties, with the active and important participation of the United States, the Camp David framework and the subsequent Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty were signed by the leaders of the two countries and witnessed by the President of the United States. Israel made major concessions and took considerable risks by signing those agreements, l.et me cite only our withdrawal from the oilfields in Sinai, for there is no need for me to waste words on the significance and implications of that step in this day and age. Similarly I need only point to the strategic depth in Sinai which Israel has relinquished, as well as to the advanced air bases located in Sinai, the evacuation of which will be implemented in due course in accordance with the terms of the Peace Treaty.
68.	Israel believed that its concessions and sacrifices would be met with appreciation and understanding by the world community and that a long-awaited breakthrough would be achieved on the international scene. Not only has that not 06itte about, but many countries in the world have spared no effort to destroy that hard-won peace, and Israel continues to be the object of unending accusations and attacks.
69.	Nevertheless, the decision and determination of Israel remain firm to continue on the road to peace. Thus, in accordance with the Camp David framework, negotiations have taken place for the attainment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea. Samaria and the Gaza District.
70.	Substantial progress has been achieved in these talks in certain fields, but the talks have, it is true, had their tips and downs and have even been suspended a number of times by Egypt. There is nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the difficulties encountered thus far in the progress of the talks. They reflect the complexities inherent in the subjects under discussion. The difficulties are familiar to any country which, at one time or another, has been engaged in complex negotiations involving multifaceted and long-standing problems.
71.	One area in which progress has been achieved in the negotiations is the modalities of the free elections to be held in the territories concerned. These procedures would make the proposed autonomy into one of the few—all too few— examples of free democratic process in the Middle East. Progress has also been achieved in the area of powers and responsibilities of the autonomy covering many aspects of the everyday life of the inhabitants of the territories in question.
72.	We certainly believe that autonomy can and must be established. All the parties to the Camp David framework are convinced that the process set out in that framework is the only one which is within the realm of the possible. All alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem at hand—ideas such as the holding of an international conference or the like—are devoid of real prospect or purpose. No one can really believe that the various elements in the Middle East which arc so much at odds with each other would attend a peace conference and achieve a positive outcome that would lead to a solution acceptable to all. Thus too the ideas entertained by the European Community, which do not take Israel's position into account, are only likely to encourage those who are opposed to peace.
73.	Those who genuinely seek peace should encourage the progress which has been achieved through the Camp David process. Let them also bear in mind and give due regard to the fact that, by proposing the idea of autonomy in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, Israel has taken on itself great risks for the sake of peace.
74.	We hope that the autonomy talks will be resumed in the near future. We also hope that the process of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt will be intensified and will serve as the best possible proof and a living symbol of the fact that peace can and must take the place of war. The full significance of these peaceful relations should be grasped for what they are—and for what they may lead to—as the very corner-stone for peace in the region.
75. The leaders of Israel and Egypt have reiterated time and again their mutual commitment to the proposition that there will be no more war. Let us hope that the change which has come about in the Middle East with the signing of peace will be the opening for a positive and long-lasting transformation in the history of our conflict-ridden area. The strict adherence to the agreements by Israel, in accordance with their letter and spirit alike, is a guarantee of the continuation of the peace process. However, by itself it is not enough. We hope that all the others involved will act in the same way.
76. Much has been alleged against Israel in the name of the principle of self-determination for nations. We favour that concept, and we have proved that in the support that we extended to many States which have achieved their independence in our generation, in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. The Governments of those States and their peoples know that full well. But there is no connection between that principle and the perverted attempt to turn self-determination into the basis for the destruction of the Stale of Israel, as certain States are endeavouring to do. Anyone who is familiar with the ideology and the terminology of the murder organization that calls itself the PLO, as well as with the declarations of the various Arab rejectionist States, can see beyond all doubt that the term ""self-determination"", as they use it, is nothing more than a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.
77.	It should not be forgotten that the Palestinian Arabs have achieved their self-determination in Jordan, a State which is the Arab State in Palestine, by virtue of its history, territory, population, culture and all aspects of its national life. The establishment of a second Palestinian Arab Slate by distorting the principle of self-determination means the creation of an extremist and hostile base opposed to the very-existence of Israel. Hence we will not agree to a distorted form of self-determination, which in reality implies self-destruction for our ancient nation deeply rooted in its own land.
78.	The programme of autonomy which we have proposed for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, as accepted in principle in the Camp David frameworks, is the first practical proposal to be advanced to provide a dignified solution for the needs of the Arab population of those areas. It comes in place of all the empty declarations with which the Palestinian Arabs concerned have deluded themselves and have been deluded by other States and organizations over the years.
79.	One of the most vivid expressions of the rejection of all peace proposals by the Arab rejectionist States is to be seen in their unprecedented military build-up and in the armaments which they have received in recent years from the Soviet bloc or purchased from the United States and Western Europe. In the course of the last three years, orders for arms purchases by the larger Arab States have reached astronomic sums. The quantities of arms that were actually supplied have been equally staggering. There is no precedent for the amassing of arms on this scale in our region. Those arms are designated first and foremost for use against Israel. But the implications of that vast array of armaments ait not confined to my country alone. It also serves to inject war into the area at large.
80.	We call upon the United Nations to take due note of the military build-up by the Arab rejectionist States and to urge them to decrease their armament. For our part, we are prepared to lend a hand in any joint effort to bring about the limitation of arms in our region which is poised on top of a volcano.
81. I should like to address myself to another crucial aspect of disarmament. Israel has consistently supported resolutions of the General Assembly aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This global problem, we believe, can best be solved by means of negotiated regional arrangements. Hence, since 1975, Israel has consistently advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East on the Tlatelolco model. Israel believes that an international conference of all the Slates in the region and adjacent to our region should be held, leading to the conclusion of a formal, contractual, multilateral convention among all States of the region.
82.	We hope that in the course of this General Assembly, we shall find a suitable opportunity to give concrete expression to our views on this matter. In the meantime, I should like to reiterate my Government's position, which is that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israeli dispute.
83.	In the last months, Jerusalem has been the object of attacks on Israel in various international forums. There has been much hypocrisy and cynicism in those attacks, For, truth to tell, never has the situation of the various religions represented in Jerusalem been better than that prevailing since the unification of the city by Israel in 1967. For 19 years, between 1948 and 1967, the eastern part of the city was under Jordanian occupation and barbed wire divided it in two. Places holy to the Jews were maliciously desecrated. Ancient synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed in a barbaric manner, and Jews were denied access to the Holy Places which are the spiritual life-blood of the Jewish people. It is not out of place to remark that the Moslem Arab citizens of Israel were also denied access to their Holy Places during that ignoble period. And where, I am bound to ask, was the voice of this Organization during that period"".' Not once was it raised in condemnation of those illegal acts.
84.	On the other hand, since 1967. all—irrespective of religion and nationality—have been accorded free access to the city of Jerusalem and the possibility of worshipping at the Holy Places and shrines revered by them. Israel has assured the free and unfettered observance of the religious rites of all members of all faiths, who also administer their religious lives and their Holy Places without any outside interference. That is the truth well known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to everyone who has visited the city. There is no substance or basis to any claim to the contrary.
85.	There is no need for me to dwell at length on the bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem. The Jewish people is the only people which has made Jerusalem its capital since it appeared as a nation on the stage of human history. Throughout the many years of exile inflicted on it. The Jewish people prayed three times a day, every day, for its restoration to Jerusalem.
86. For the last 150 years there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Whoever seeks to sever Jerusalem from Israel seeks to decapitate the Jewish people. We hope that nations that seek peace and know the reality which prevails in Jerusalem today will respect the city as the sovereign capital of Israel; a city which will not be divided again, in the same way as Israel respects the Holy Places of all religions and their freedoms in the city.
87.	I wish to conclude with a call in the spirit of the Prophets of Israel, who were a light and an inspiration for much of mankind. My call is for peace—peace which is at the very basis of the existence of the United Nations.
88.	We in Israel yearn for peace. We have done so since the first day of the restoration of our national sovereignty—in our Declaration of Independence, which was issued on the very day that the State of Israel was founded in 1948. In that Declaration, we extend the hand of peace and good neighbourliness to all the States around us and all their peoples. We have taken far-reaching steps and have made huge sacrifices for the sake of peace. But peace with Israel does not mean peace without Israel, or peace at its expense. Nor does it mean peace with a weak Israel deprived of its capital and with its wings clipped from the security and geostrategic viewpoints. With such an Israel peace will not be attained, because a weak Israel will be an object of unceasing attacks and destructive designs.
89.	I wish to call upon the Arab States which are our neighbours, and also upon the Palestinian Arabs living in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, to follow the dictates of reason and to join the peace process. I wish to call upon the other nations of the world to support this course and to prevail upon the Arab States to adopt it. The world at large, and not merely our region alone, will benefit from this.
"
5,1986,"ISR_prev_1998","This session of the Assembly opens the fifth decade of the United Nations. I hope that it will begin an era in which this body will come closer to realizing the dreams of its founding fathers.
Their ideals were inspired and inspiring: safeguarding the principles of universality and equality, a genuine desire to maintain international peace and security, encouraging international cooperation in solving global problems and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Unfortunately, those lofty principles have been vitiated and perverted beyond recognition. Extremists have seized this body. They have compelled it to shun the only peace treaty in the Middle East - the Camp David Accords. They have forced upon it an annual ritual of adopting dozens of distorted and irrelevant resolutions relating to my country. In clinging to these barren exercises, the United Nations spends precious time and funds, resources that could profitably be used to combat
hunger and poverty.
These and other issues remain unresolved, however, and they demand serious and responsible attention. First among them is the repugnant reign of apartheid in South Africa.
Israel, founded upon basic moral and democratic values, cannot remain silent in the face of racial discrimination, wherever it nay occur.. We reject and condemn apartheid as a political, social and economic system. Israel also believes that violence is not the path to reform in South Africa. We must urgently foster a climate that will facilitate a political settlement if we are to avoid a further drift towards economic chaos, suffering and bloodshed. We hope responsible leaders on all sides will act to create such a climate and that the Government of South Africa will initiate negotiations that will satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of all South Africans, regardless of race or color.

In the heart of the African continent many continue to suffer from hunger, disease and poverty. There is a growing awareness around the world of the need to provide help. People must be fed right now. We have contributed to that effort, but we also believe that we must help countries afflicted by hunger to develop the long-term means to prevent its recurrence and to set their economies on the road to development and growth.
This past year the General Assembly convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The Organization of African unity (OAU) has outlined a development strategy that is reminiscent of Israel's own development experience. Israel announced at that special session its readiness to make immediate contributions to the attainment of those goals. We offered to share our experience in agriculture and desertification, in medicine and education and in the general field of economic development. Many in Africa remember our earlier contributions in this field. Our experience has been gained in 28 years of assistance by Israel to more than 100 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We have trained over 55,000 professionals from developing countries. We have shared our experience with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. And we are ready and willing to do more.
Many of those African States that severed relations with Israel in 1973 and 1974 are now in the process of resuming those relations. I wish to commend the leadership and courage of the Heads of State who have gone on to re-establish formal diplomatic ties with us despite the pressures exerted upon them. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all African nations and we expect many more countries to resume full diplomatic relations with Israel in the near future.
The Middle East, with its vast resources of land and minerals, has within it the potential to leap into a new age in the twenty-first century - an age of great economic prosperity and a better life for millions. But that hope hangs on the outcome of a precarious contest between those who seek progress and those who continually plunge the region into turmoil and hatred.
Perhaps the most tragic instance of the fanaticism that plagues our region is the cruel war waged by Iran and Iraq for the past six years. That war has claimed well over a million casualties; it has reintroduced outlawed means of warfare such as gas and chemical weapons and the wholesale torture of prisoners; it has hurt the entire world by threatening freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil. It is a sad commentary that, despite their various proclamations, those two warring Governments show no intention whatsoever of genuinely seeking ways to stop the horrible carnage.
Another instance of the reign of fanaticism and its terrible human cost is Lebanon. The tragedy is rooted in the chronic absence of an effective Government able to control and reconcile the warring factions. Without such a strong central authority, Lebanon has been unable to discharge the most elementary obligations of government - the control of one's territory against lawlessness and terror, terror directed against one's own citizens and against the citizens of neighboring States.
The first to pay for that anarchy have been the Lebanese themselves. Over 100,000 were slaughtered in the civil war of 1975-1976 and thousands of others have been killed since in sectarian clashes. Lebanon's Government has set no effective jurisdiction over any part of the country: not over the Bekaa Valley or Tripoli, where 20,000 Syrian troops physically occupy Lebanese territory; not over the Shouf Mountains; not even over Beirut itself. Such conditions encourage the reign of the gun, the rocket and the bomb throughout Lebanon. Naturally, the southern part of the country has not been exempt from that dismal pattern. Beginning with the PLO, various terrorist groups have used the south as a staging area for terrorist attacks against Israel. Those who expected that a ""Pax Syriana"" would pacify Lebanon were hopelessly deluded,.for Syrian domination of Lebanon has meant that Syria has been playing off one factor against another, as well as using Lebanon as a base for proxy terror attacks against Israel
and against targets world-wide.
That Syrian strategy, now shared by Iran, should concern the entire international community. As for Israel, we have one, and only one, objective regarding Lebanon: to protect northern Israel against attacks launched from Lebanon. This is self-defense in its simplest form. We shall not let Israeli citizens pay with their lives for Lebanon's failure to control its territory. We shall continue to take the necessary measures to defend our people. We hope that Lebanon will produce an effective Government with which we can agree on permanent security arrangements. In the meantime we shall continue to work with any Lebanese party genuinely interested in preventing terror in the South of Lebanon and in the North of Israel.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has tried to assist in bringing stability to the area. It has performed a useful role. It has suffered painful casualties in the process, including losses sustained in a recent rash of murderous attacks. We extend ou£r deepest condolences to the bereaved families end their Governments. We must be clear, however, on what role UNIFIL can and cannot play. International forces are most effective when they serve as buffers between two States that share a commitment to pacifying their common border. Unlike Israel's neighbors on two other borders, that is not the case with Lebanon. That is why UNIFIL, unlike the multinational Force in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, has been unable to act as an effective buffer, since the day it was established by the United Nations. Peace-keepers cannot be asked to combat terrorists. That role must be left to the Governments and the peoples in the area of turmoil. We shall continue to co-operate with UNIFIL, as we maintain the necessary security arrangements to defend our norther border.
Israel watches with concern the larger conflicts waged in our region: those between radicals and non-radicals, between conservative regimes and revolutionaries, among militant religious movements, and among the various dictatorships themselves. But there is little we can do to affect this tragic and chronic violence. Where we can act - where we have acted and shall continue to act - is in the limited confines of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.
Ever since Israel's independence we have made every effort to achieve peace with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our heritage. The Jewish people is a democratic and free people striving to rebuild its national life in the ancient - the only - homeland of the Jews. Israel is a haven for the persecuted, a land where ever Jew from whatever background feels at home. We can best achieve our ideals and goals in an atmosphere of peace and security. Hence, we cherish peace? we pray for it and we teach its blessings to our children. Our entire people rejoiced when, after decades of war which were forced upon us, we were able to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
During the past year we have made special efforts to broaden that peace. In July, Prime Minister Peres visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. We have made efforts to reinforce the peace treaty with Egypt and to solve the problems that are still outstanding. We hope we are on the threshold of a substantial improvement in the relations between our two countries. Such an improvement is vital in and of itself, and of even greater importance for the prospects for peace
with other Arab States.
A few days ago we marked the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. With the passage of time we can see that those accords were a turning-point in the history of the Middle East. They have proved decisively that there is a way out of the cycle of belligerency, and they have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no alternative to direct negotiations. To this very day they remain the one and only blueprint for accommodation and peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. All attempts to bypass, nullify or denigrate the Camp David accords have failed. Those attempts have been unsuccessful because they have disregarded the minimal needs of all parties, because they were not rooted in achievable proposals acceptable to all the sides.
Camp David accords are still the leading parties to which everyone concerned with peace in the Middle East turns. Together they hold the key to progress towards peace. With its commitment to the accords, Egypt has gained in prestige and stature. Many of those in the Arab world who once attacked and boycotted it are now looking to Egypt to play a leading role in peace negotiations. The United States, of course, is equally sought after. Many have come to appreciate the positive influence it brings to bear on the political process in our region.
For its part, Israel remains anxious and willing to move the peace process forward without delay. The peace treaty with Egypt was intended to be the first in a series of treaties that together would constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.
Those who are afraid of peace or who are seeking to evade peace with Israel are trying to promote an alternative to direct negotiations, and ultimately to peace itself, through an international conference. Let me repeat again: Experience proves that the only path to peace is through direct negotiations. Substitutes for such negotiations can only lead us away from peace. The history of our region provides anple evidence of this simple truth.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly called upon King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct peace negotiations with Israel. We recognize that once he decides to respond to our call Jordan may face considerable opposition from some Arab quarters. That opposition, however, will not be deflected or appeased by such devices as an international conference. Ultimately, Jordan will have to decide whether the advantages of peace with Israel outweigh the risks and difficulties involved in making such a move. But Jordan must understand that its peace will have to be with Israel, not with an international body. The first sign of a
genuine willingness to move towards peace is a declared readiness to deal directly with one's former adversary. There is no other way to a genuine reconciliation.
We firmly believe that the absence of democracy and freedom in our region is a major obstacle to peace. Only democracy offers the guarantee of freedom, the hope of progress and the prospect of peace. We do not believe any people want war. We do not believe the Arab peoples want war. Wars of aggression are initiated by Governments that do not represent the will of their peoples and fail to reflect their aspirations. That is why we must hope that democratic Governments will prevail throughout the Middle East on a not too distant day, for on that day true and permanent peace will come to our region. To hasten the coming of that day we call on all countries interested in peace in the Middle East strongly to support direct talks between Jordan and Israel. We call on them strongly to signify their willingness to buttress and strengthen a peace settlement by declaring their readiness to endorse it immediately. In addition, the supporters of peace should undertake to extend whatever assistance and support may be needed by the Government and the people of Jordan to embark on an ambitious development Program that will accompany the implementation of the peace treaty. The rewards of peace must be swift and exemplary, and serve to belie the words of its opponents.
Our region - the entire world in fact - is plagued by the spread of Arab terrorism. There is no limit to its atrocities. Even places of worship are not immune to this wanton murder. The recent attack on a synagogue in Istanbul was merely the latest and deadliest in a series of such attacks on Jewish places of worship. But Jews are not the only victims. Arab terror has made a blood pact with terrorists from all over the world to fight the common enemy, of which Israel and Jews are merely a part. That enemy is the community of democratic nations. The fight against this menace is therefore the fight of all civilized and free nations.
The so-called PLO was the linchpin of this alliance in terror; it pioneered the art of hijacking, bombing, kidnapping and massacre on an international scale. In the decade preceding 1982 the PLO used its mini-State in Lebanon to train and arm terrorist groups from five continents, from left-wing extremists to neo-Nazi gangs. Libya, Syria and Iran joined in financing, training and arming the terrorists and providing them with safe havens.
Since our action in Lebanon in 1982, the PLO has disintegrated into a number of rival terrorist gangs, most of them mercenaries in the service of various Governments. Their one common objective is to sabotage any attempt at peace and stability. The legacy of terror that they have created has encouraged other terrorist groups, many of them possessed by a mad desire to spread anarchy and terror for no reason whatsoever.
Much has been said about ways to combat international terrorism, but little has been done. Terrorism will continue to take its toll as long as the terrorists believe they can kill with impunity and achieve legitimacy and their political goals in the process. They must be denied these victories. They must never be appeased. They must never be ""understood"". They must always be condemned and fought vigorously. If we are serious in our desire to rid ourselves of international terrorism, we must adopt a broad and comprehensive campaign against the terrorists.
We must expel the representatives of terrorist organizations, starting with the PLO, from all countries committed to the fight against terror. We should hunt down the terrorist killers. They must always be on the run. But no matter what measures we take against the killers themselves, they will not be enough. If we do not go to the source, to the regimes whose support and protection make terrorism possible, we will not succeed in rolling back the tide of terror. We must isolate
and punish those terrorist States. We should shut down their embassies, expel their diplomats, curtail trade with them, and co-ordinate a military response if they persist in attacking us. Those who refuse to address the problem of State-supported terrorism are not merely failing to solve the problem? they are
facilitating its expansion.
Last year, from this rostrum, I spoke of three major threats facing the countries of the Middle East: the escalating race in conventional arms, the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the grave problem of chemical warfare. Unfortunately, little if anything has been done to reduce those threats. In fact, in some ways the situation has worsened in the past year.
The most dramatic development has been the increased use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran. This has been investigated by the united Nations and condemned by the President of the Security Council on behalf of its members. There is also considerable evidence that other States in the Middle East, most notably Syria, are developing a chemical warfare capability. The free world should pool information on this subject and adopt concerted measures to prevent the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons. We cannot afford to cower before dictatorships that stockpile these inhuman inventories, especially since these regimes have shown no hesitation in using them.
To our disappointment, negotiations on a nuclear-weapon-free zone among the States in the region have yet to begin. It is our firm belief that, in an area as sensitive as the Middle East, the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation would be a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries were among those which supported the establishment of our State in 1948. But things have changed. With the exception of Romania, all the Eastern-bloc countries have severed their diplomatic ties with us and adopted a one-sided policy towards the Middle East. We welcome, of course, any sincere attempt at improving relations and re-establishing diplomatic ties between us and any Eastern European country.
This year, for the first time in nearly 20 years, an official meeting took place in Helsinki between representatives of Israel and the Soviet Union. We hope that it is a sign of a positive change in the policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel. Without such a renewal of diplomatic relations and without a major change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Soviet Jews - especially the policy that prevents them from exercising their basic right of repatriation to Israel - it is difficult to see how the Soviet Union could contribute in any way to the attainment of peace in our region.
The plight of our Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union has been raised countless times by Israel's representatives and by world leaders; yet the tragic suffering continues. The hope that a new leadership in the Soviet Union would bring with it an improvement in the situation of Soviet Jewry has, so far, not been borne out. The condition of Soviet Jews, especially those among them wishing to leave for Israel, has deteriorated still further.
In a country of over 100 nationalities, speaking over 100 languages, Jews remain the only officially recognized nationality in the Soviet Union denied the right to maintain its cultural heritage and pass it on to the next generation. They are forbidden to study their ancient language, Hebrew. Throughout the entire length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not a single Jewish school where Jews may study their history, literature and traditions.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Soviet Union have expressed their desire to join their people in Israel. But the Soviet authorities have effectively stopped Jewish emigration; less than 500 Jews were allowed to leave during the first eight months of this year. Thousands have had their requests for exit permits repeatedly refused on the flimsiest of pretexts; as punishment for daring to apply to leave, they have been subjected to all manner of harassment and reprisals. Among those ""refuseniks"" are the prisoners-of-Zion, who have been subjected to arrests and lengthy terms of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. The real reason for their imprisonment is painfully clear: it is their insistence on their right to emigrate to Israel and their right to study Hebrew and persevere in their Jewish heritage.
The Soviet policy towards Soviet Jews is a flagrant violation of the International Convention on Human Rights, to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. It is totally contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Accords. The refusal of the Soviet Government to fulfill its most elementary humanitarian obligations must weigh heavily in the considerations of all who would contemplate entering into agreements with the Soviet Union on any subject.
Prom this rostrum, I call upon Governments and people of good will everywhere to urge the Soviet Government to bring its behavior towards Soviet Jews into line with universally accepted international standards. We in Israel will not rest until every Jew in the Soviet Union is permitted to exercise his right to emigrate and until Jews are free to follow their ancestral traditions and faith.
Another beleaguered Jewish community are the Jews of Syria. They are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies. They are not free to live wherever they wish. Several hundred young Jewish women cannot
find husbands in the Jewish community. The Syrian Government has callously refused to allow then to leave the country so that they may marry within their faith and establish families. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return. All that, too, is another instance of flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Syria is a signatory.
None of the problems I have described, including those relating to our region, is insoluble. They can be resolved if the Governments involved muster genuine good will, we turn again to the leaders of our Arab neighbors with an outstretched hand of peace. Let us bring an end to belligerency and hatred. Let us make real the hopes for a new era of understanding and coexistence. We shall not spare any effort in this quest, nor will we give up hope that it will bear fruit.
The eyes and hearts of millions of human beings who are wasting away from hunger and poverty, who live under oppressive regimes that deny them basic human rights, who are victims of barbaric terror, are turned towards us in the hope that we can alleviate their suffering. They look to us, to this body, for the hope of a better future. We cannot let them down and still claim fidelity to the ideals of this Organization. We bear the responsibility to begin action now for their sakes and for the sake of our place in history. Let us not forsake them, or our aspirations for a better and safer world."
5,1984,"ISR_prev_1998","It gives me pleasure, Mr. President, to associate myself with the warm congratulations offered to you from this rostrum. They are a tribute to your country and to yourself, as well as to a continent which is playing such a prominent role in the United Nations. I hope and trust that, under your leadership and guidance, the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be constructive, positive and responsive to the grave problems that face us.
101.	It is gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year, reinforced with new partners in our common endeavours. The United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality. The only attitude we should disavow is the promotion of narrow, selfish interests which run counter to our common international efforts.
102.	Every session of the General Assembly must set out in a spirit of hope that, despite the disappointments of the past, we can and should renew our efforts and work for a better world. Forty years ago, the founders of the United Nations looked back on a tragic past and undertook to forge instruments that would ensure a better future for humanity. So do we, in accordance with ancient Jewish tradition, look back year after year upon the disappointments of the past with firm belief in a better future, buoyed by an unflagging hope in the triumph of that human spirit which never deserts us.
103.	The fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War will occur in 1985, as has already been noted from this rostrum. This was a landmark in history and even more so in the annals of my people. Israel and the Jewish people, who still carry so many scars of that terrible war, will commemorate the occasion appropriately. The event will undoubtedly be marked by all nations, as was indeed recommended by the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which invited States Members ""to adopt . . . measures declaring punishable by law any dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . . including Nazi, Fascist and neo- Fascist ideologies"". The Assembly also appealed to all States to accede to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. There are still a few pockets of neo-Nazism that continue to linger, and they should be dealt with firmly, but the true heirs to this inhuman creed are those organizations and Governments that continue to this day to deny the right of existence of another State and strive for its outright destruction. There should be no room in civilized society for such doctrines or for those who promote them.
104.	The United Nations concept embraces the whole of mankind. Its raison d'etre is the welfare, present and future, of humanity, with special attention accorded to the underprivileged, the disabled and the oppressed. Our special attention should be focused on the problems of children and of youth and on their appropriate education and training. This should be our central task in building up our nations and societies.
105.	The coming year will be marked by the conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women, with the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the Decade to be held at Nairobi. Our hope is that that Conference will become a high point in women's struggle for equality and will not be exploited for narrow and barren political interests.
106.	Technological progress holds the promise of providing solutions to some of the most pressing problems of developing nations, but nowhere is it more sorely needed than in the field of agriculture and food production. It is now widely recognized that the international development effort has failed to meet its most important challenge, the production of food for the fast-growing population of our world. Agriculture is the key to the present challenge, but its development and that of the rural society that sustains it have been sadly neglected.
107.	Great strides have been made world-wide in industry, in the development of infrastructure, transportation, education and health, but food production has remained deficient. It is a terribly sad comment on our society that in this modern age millions go hungry and die of famine; hundreds of millions, mainly children, suffer malnutrition, their future as productive members of their society endangered. Per capita food production in Africa, for instance, has in fact dropped 15 per cent in the last decade. Countries in other continents have required emergency food supplies. Nations that were once self-sufficient have become importers of food and, as a result of their economic difficulties stemming from the increase in the cost of energy, their true independence has become endangered.
108.	Catastrophe awaits many nations if we do not find the way to assure adequate food for our world's growing population. World security and stability begin with the assurance of basic human needs. A change of direction is thus urgently needed in the goals of international development. That is the challenge of this decade. This goal can be reached despite the scarcity of arable land and water and despite the meagre resources that are available in various countries. In fact, Israel has emerged in only one generation from severe austerity and food rationing to self-reliance; we have increased our food production twelvefold and have become a net exporter of food.
109.	Israel recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its programme for international development co-operation. This programme had its beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the emergence of newly independent nations that sought rapid development. Imbued with a pioneering spirit that thrived on successful adaptation and innovation in the development of their own country, the people of Israel considered it a duty to share the knowledge acquired through their own rapid development experience with the peoples of other emerging nations.
110.	Israel calls upon all Governments to set aside political differences and narrow economic interests to join forces in the campaign against hunger. Israel will continue to co-operate with other nations in technology and development and stands ready to join other Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in working to meet this great challenge to humanity.
111.	Israel is the fulfilment of an age-old dream and prayer for the re-establishment of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel. It is the home of all Jews who wish to make it their home, and it is the defender and protector of all Jews who are oppressed or persecuted because they belong to the Jewish people. These principles are enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence, in its laws and in the conscience of its people.
112.	We are aghast at the fact that, 40 years after the eradication of Nazism, rampant anti-Semitism and racial discrimination still exist in a number of countries. The situation of Soviet Jewry has recently taken a definite turn for the worse. From this rostrum I call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to remove the harsh limitations and restrictions imposed upon Jews who seek repatriation and reunion with their brethren in Israel. The continued harassment of Soviet Jews has become one of the most pressing humanitarian problems of the day, a violation of the most basic human rights as expressed in the Helsinki accords. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are being systematically denied their rights and many are forced to live as outcasts, deprived of their livelihood, harassed or imprisoned in gaols and labour camps under inhuman conditions.
113.	Soviet Jews are deprived of access to Jewish culture. A systematic campaign is waged against those Soviet Jews teaching and studying the Hebrew language. Ill-concealed under the cloak of anti-zionism, officially inspired anti-Semitism is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media.
114.	We call upon the Soviet Government to change its policy, which is unjustifiable. The Soviet Jews are not involved in any anti-Soviet activity, nor are they violating Soviet laws or working against Soviet interests. Their only wish is to study their ancient culture and their national language and to live as Jews in their historic homeland. It should be recalled that in front of this very Assembly official representatives of the Soviet Union have declared that the Jewish people have a right to a State of their own. Soviet Jewry demands nothing more than to exercise this right.
115.	In our own part of the world, the Middle East, the Jews of Syria continue to suffer under a harsh regime that holds them hostage and refuses to grant them basic human rights, the most important of which is the right to emigrate and join their brethren. Periodic killings of Jews, either sanctioned or tolerated by the authorities, maintain a climate of terror among the Jews of Syria.
116.	In Ethiopia, an ancient Jewish community struggles to maintain its heritage, culture and integrity under dire hardship. We acknowledge the gesture of the Ethiopian Government, which has recently enabled Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to visit that community, and we express our sincere hope that it will take all necessary steps to protect and respect their religious and cultural rights and enable those who so desire to be reunited with their families in their ancient homeland.
117.	On 13 September 1984, a Government of national unity, encompassing the overwhelming majority of political parties in Israel, was established. Its creation is a reflection of the wide consensus that unites the people of Israel on the main issues on the Government's agenda in the economic, defence and political domains.
118.	In its foreign relations, Israel is dedicated, as always, to the goal of peace and accommodation with all its neighbours. In the north, we stand ready to reach an understanding with Lebanon which will guarantee the security of our common border and thus make possible the withdrawal of all forces from southern Lebanon. Syria remains dogmatically opposed to the idea of peace with Israel. Nevertheless, we are adamant in our conviction that there can be no solution other than peace. In the east, we have repeatedly called on the Government of Jordan to join us in negotiations for peace. In the south, of course, we have peace with Egypt, but we are convinced that peaceful relations should be deepened and strengthened in the face of so much rejectionist pressure against peace.
119.	The chances of progress towards further peace and stability between Israel and its neighbours must be appraised, however, in the context of the realities of the region.
120.	The Middle East continues to be beset by violence, bitter conflicts and wars. In a few weeks of bloodshed along the Iran-Iraq border, more men and children die than in all the Arab-Israel wars. Thousands die every year in domestic strife and hostilities entirely unconnected with the Arab-Israel conflict. Yet, as everyone in this Hall knows full well, a disproportionate amount of the time of the General Assembly is devoted year after year to a contrived and counter-productive review of the Arab-Israel conflict, the main purpose of which seems to be only to slander Israel.
121.	In the last two decades, the violence and oppression that characterize so many regimes in the Middle East have erupted on the international scene in waves of terrorism, hijacking and assassination. When in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed that the United Nations promote measures to counter international terrorism, we were among the first to welcome that initiative. Regrettably, it has been thwarted by States that sponsor and support terrorism. Middle Eastern terrorism, sanctioned by these Governments, has been thus allowed, through neglect and indifference, to expand to more and more countries. Today the cancer of terrorism has spread to all continents. The latest form of terrorism and international piracy is the mines that threaten shipping and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Recently, we were again horrified by the murderous bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a calculated and deliberate act of terrorism.
122.	Terror is a malignant disease that will spread everywhere if not contained. But at least in one instance concerted international effort has produced results. When terrorism first raised its ugly head in the mid-1960s, its prime target was international civil aviation. Planes were hijacked almost daily, aircraft bombed, passengers terrorized and murdered. The proper functioning of civil aviation today is a result of powerful measures taken jointly by many nations to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft and to combat the threat of hijackings. But such successful international co-operation remains an exception. Terrorism is still an item on the Assembly's agenda, but it is debated ineffectively, shunted aside by vested interests which offer its representatives support, sustenance and even quasi- recognition. As long as the family of nations continues to evade its responsibilities, to appease rather than punish, to pardon terrorists rather than prosecute or extradite them, to afford terrorists diplomatic immunity, the disease will spread and claim yet more victims in our homes and communities.
123.	Whenever a particularly outrageous terrorist attack takes place, as for example the recent bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a wave of outrage sweeps public opinion in all parts of the civilized world. People naturally demand instant retaliation against such despicable acts and a fitting punishment for the criminal perpetrators.
124.	While punishment has its necessary place in any system of justice, the overriding problem here is not whom to punish and how punishment should be delivered. Rather, it is how to prevent terrorism and root it out from the international arena. There is only one way to deal with this problem. Those countries which agree that terrorism must be eradicated should join forces and wage a permanent war on the terrorist organizations. This is the only way to expose, pre-empt, weaken and finally destroy them. This is a war of self-defence in its true sense, a campaign that the free world should undertake on behalf of its peoples and of the entire human race.
125.	For its part, Israel has been waging an unrelenting war on Arab terrorism and has dealt it a number of crippling blows. The so-called PLO, which had established its own mini-terrorist State in Lebanon, from which it carried out and assisted terrorist acts in five continents, was expelled from that country. But Israel cannot be expected to shoulder alone the burden of fighting international terrorism. Since we are all potential victims of terror, we must fight it together. If we do not, terrorism will endanger our basic freedoms and all the standards of civilized behaviour for which the United Nations stands.
126.	The attitude underpinning Arab terrorist attacks against Israel is the continued denial by Arab States of Israel's right to exist. Translated into wanton attacks on civilians, the ideology is cruel and inhuman. But it has produced the very opposite result to that intended. Israel has taken the necessary measures to protect its people and enable them to live and prosper alongside their Arab neighbours throughout the Land of Israel. We have to state with regret that any sign of ostensible moderation in the attitude of Arab Governments towards Israel is negated by their sustenance and support of terrorist organizations committed to Israel's destruction and by their continued attempts to expel Israel from United Nations bodies and other international organizations. We will welcome a change in the Arab stance if it is given concrete expression, such as a clear-cut disengagement from the so-called PLO and other terrorist organizations and a straightforward statement of readiness to make peace with Israel.
127.	Sadly, such a breakthrough for peace was set back by the General Assembly's rejection of the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, for no other reason than that certain Arab States reject the idea of peace with Israel. Camp David has been the only ray of light in an otherwise dismal and dark picture of hostility. It will continue to serve as a beacon of hope until its message is finally accepted by the peoples and Governments of our region.
128.	The United Nations can contribute to peace in the Middle East by a change of direction. It should embrace the idea of peace between Israel and its neighbours condemn the blatant attacks on Israel and reject outright the attempts to expel it from international forums. Recently, an attempt to expel Israel from the UPU was properly rejected by an overwhelming majority. It is now time for the United Nations as a whole to muster the courage to condemn such behaviour. It will mark an important milestone in rehabilitating the image of the United Nations and its standing in the world community.
129.	Recently, the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East was resurrected. It was advanced by a State that has no diplomatic relations with Israel and that recommends the participation of representatives of terrorist groups. The Arab-Israel dispute is not in need of another international forum. There have been more than enough such gatherings and proposals, and they have all proved futile. They served as a stage for propaganda and for competition between Arab States in the politics of public confrontation with Israel. A conference such as the one being proposed would strike a blow at the principle of direct negotiations, which has proved to be the only means of producing agreements between Israel and its neighbours, from the time of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949 through the Camp David accords in 1978.
130.	We therefore call on Member States that have the interest of peace at heart to bring their influence to bear on our Arab neighbours to the east and north to adopt the only successful and tested path to peace—direct negotiations with Israel.
131.	Such negotiations produced the agreement with Lebanon which was signed on 17 May 1983. That agreement provided for security arrangements against terrorism and an agreed basis for normal relations between our two countries across the recognized international boundaries. It was approved by the legislatures of Israel and Lebanon, but Syria and those that cannot tolerate the idea of peace with Israel destroyed it by the application of sheer, brutal force. The agreement was designed to lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the restoration of Lebanese independence and the establishment of security measures along the Lebanon- Israel border.
132.	Today, some 40,000 Syrian troops occupy 65 per cent of Lebanon and show no sign of any intention to leave. The Lebanese Government is dominated by Syria and is not capable of conducting free negotiations that would resolve its problems with Israel. Obviously, Israel will ensure its legitimate security needs and make the necessary arrangements in southern Lebanon to protect the people of northern Israel against any repetition of the terrorist attacks of recent years. I reiterate our readiness to withdraw all our forces from Lebanon, subject to the above-mentioned arrangements.
133.	By now it should be clear to everyone, including the Arab States in our area, that Israel has no interest in maintaining any military presence in Lebanon. But we have to make certain that after the last Israeli soldier leaves Lebanon, the terrorists will not return to attack us.
134.	Let me repeat: anyone, any people or State that is interested in the evacuation of the Israel army from Lebanon must see to it that the terrorist organizations expelled from Lebanon by Israel do not return to our borders to renew their attacks. This is an essential condition for peace. Israel is ready to cooperate in any serious effort towards a fair solution to this problem.
135.	Since the conclusion of the Camp David accords, Israel has repeatedly called on Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Arabs to join in negotiations for an agreement on autonomy. Unfortunately, Egypt has discontinued its participation in the talks, while Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs have refused to join them. Arab rejectionism and extremism continue to have a stranglehold on those who may have been willing to embark on the path of moderation and peace.
136.	From this rostrum, I turn yet again to our neighbours with the same call. Let us move forward together on a new path. Let us talk to one another. Let us engage in a common effort to resolve our conflicts, rather than perpetuate the negative attitudes which find frequent expression in this building.
137.	Until this call is heeded, Israel will continue to strive for an end to Arab rejectionist attitudes and aspire to mutual acceptance, tolerance, understanding and dialogue, which are consonant with the most basic goals of the United Nations.
138.	Israel is aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and of the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international arrangements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
139.	Israel has long been concerned by the dangers posed by nuclear armaments and has therefore consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
140.	We believe that the most credible barrier to proliferation in such a sensitive area as the Middle East is a freely negotiated nuclear-weapon-free zone. In this belief, we are encouraged by the Latin American experience and the recent progress towards establishing the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon- free zone.
141.	In the vital field of disarmament, we are impelled by a permanent moral imperative. Progress in this field is indispensable if we are to remove the nuclear threat. It may be a commonplace to say that time is running out, but it is nevertheless true. A very recent experience demonstrates that weapons, once they exist, are used. During the current terrible Iran- Iraq war, new non-conventional weapons, such as gas, have been used. This latest addition to the arsenal of fighting armies, against established international conventions and basic decency, cannot but arouse the deepest anxiety. It should be opposed vigorously by anyone concerned for the future of our civilization. All of us are aware that a moderation of the armament spiral, both conventional and non- conventional, will free huge resources needed for the welfare of mankind, in particular that of the developing countries.
142.	In conclusion, our mission is twofold. Our first task is the improvement of the quality of life in this world, especially for those who are suffering or who lack the means of sustenance; the hungry millions are waiting for us to do our duty. Our second task is to concert our efforts to eradicate from our midst terrorism and all other violations of civilized norms. We must dedicate equal effort to achieving both goals. We cannot accomplish our humanitarian task unless we overcome the dangers that threaten our society. Both objectives can be achieved provided we muster the courage and the will to do so. Our reward will be true peace. There can be no greater goal for the United Nations.
143.	The vision of our ancient prophets of universal peace was intended for a distant, Utopian future. But, if we succeed in removing these two formidable obstacles—hunger and terrorism—from our path, the march of humanity towards the fulfilment of that vision will be immeasurably advanced, our stride quickened and our hearts uplifted with the promise of better days."
5,1978,"ISR_prev_1998","70.	Mr. President, permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in this general debate by offering you the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will guide this session with fairness and wisdom.
71,	It is my pleasure also to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
72	As we reflect upon the work of the United Nations over the past year one undertaking stands out above all others: it is the noble attempt to reach an agreement on disarmament, to divert precious resources to improving the lot of the common man
73	In the Middle East we recently witnessed an unprecedented escalation in the quantity of weapons purchased by the Arab States, amounting to $11 billion in orders since the beginning of 1977. Indeed, over the past five years the arms agreements signed by those States mean that they have outstripped both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries members of the Warsaw Pact Organization in the ratio of their arms build-up.
74.	Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race and it remains ready to enter into agreements on arms limitation with all States in the Middle East. There is no doubt, however, that the appropriate way to bring about an arms reduction in the Middle East is through peace treaties which would include limitations on armaments within their framework Indeed, the mere transformation from a state of war to one of peace will move the States involved to dedicate their resources to economic development rather than military aims.
75.	Terrorist groups continue to threaten the lives of innocent men, women and children in different parts of the world. Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries did not continue to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. Yet we are gratified that States which once stood helplessly by have begun to assert themselves.
Mention should be made, for example, of the Federal Republic of Germany's rescue operation in Mogadishu and of the joint statement on international terrorism of the Heads of State 'or Government at the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference,6 wherein they recognized the need for immediate action to cease all flights to and from a country which refuses to extradite or prosecute hijackers of aircraft. It is only through such concerted and effective action that the world can be freed from organized terrorism.

76.	In the field of human rights no State should ignore a violation of human rights wherever it may occur in the world.
77.	Israel continues to follow closely the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. We welcome the recent increase in the number of exit visas issued, although a large number of Jews are still denied the elementary human rights to emigrate. In addition, administrative obstacles and arbitrary restrictions still threaten the social and economic livelihood and personal freedom of Jews seeking to emigrate.
78.	We have been particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences passed this year on Jews whose only crime is their desire to rejoin their families in Israel-Grigorij Goldstein, Iosif Begun, Ida Nudel, Vladimir Slepak, Simon Shnirman and Anatoly Scharansky. Those sentences caused bitter protest and indignation throughout the world. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and allow those who want to emigrate to Israel and rejoin their families to do so.
79.	We cannot be silent in the face of the increasing incitement of feeling against and defamation of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, their religion, culture and national movement, manifested day after day in the official Soviet media. Those anti-Semitic attacks, unprecedented in their intensity, may have most dangerous consequences. In this regard it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their ancient traditions and culture, and in fact take severe measures against Jews who wish to do so. We appeal Jo the Soviet Union to allow Jewish culture to be expressed freely.
80.	We also deeply regret that the Syrian Government continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and be reunited with their relatives residing in other lands.
81.	One of the most important trends in world , politics today remains the determined aspiration of the new and under-developed nations to take their place in the international political and economic arena. Being a developing nation itself, Israel strongly identifies with the aspirations of nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America to transform their political independence into a full and equal economic partnership with the older-established nations of the world.
82 To that end the North-South dialogue, with its guidelines on the transfer of resources, marks an important
beginning, and the Government of Israel appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies in encouraging this process. My Government particularly welcomes the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires, where Israel proposed a voluntary agreement for the exchange of technical assistance among developing countries. Israel has been co-operating for more than 30 years with other developing nations in fields such as irrigation techniques, seed production, desalination, solar energy and the agricultural development of arid and semi-arid zones. We view the expansion of such co-operative efforts as vital if the serious food shortages that still exist in so much of the world are to be overcome .
83.	A year ago I addressed this Assembly on the prospects of launching a peace process in the Middle East. Today I have the satisfaction of being able to address the General Assembly on the new and positive developments that have taken place recently.
84.	As all members of the Assembly know, a few weeks ago at Camp David two framework agreements8 were signed by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and witnessed by President Jimmy Carter of the United States of America. Within a very few days from now negotiations will start between Israel and Egypt for the conclusion of a peace treaty between them.
85.	It is my hope that these negotiations will be successful and that before the year is out we shall witness the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. It is our desire that the peace process should eventually embrace the other States that are our neighbours—Jordan, Lebanon and Syria-so that we may achieve a comprehensive settlement in the area.
86.	The gratitude of my country goes out to President Jimmy Carter, whose devoted efforts have made the Camp David developments possible When this achievement ends with an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, President Carter's name will be recorded in history as that of a great peacemaker.
87.	I also wish to express my country's deep appreciation to President Anwar El-Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt for his wisdom and faith. His visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 turned a new page. He decided to enter into negotiations with Israel, to recognize Israel and to make peace with Israel. This change in policy ushered in a historic change in the relations between Egypt and Israel. The previous policy based on the ""three Nos"" of Khartoum 19679—no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel—prevented any progress towards a peace settlement.
88.	Now the road to peace lies open. The warm reception accorded to President El-Sadat by the people and Government of Israel constituted an acknowledgement of this change in the Egyptian policy. A new era of peace, for which Israel has been longing since its establishment, has started. Prime Minister Begin's courage and leadership were a decisive factor. Without his readiness and ability to assume responsibility for very painful decisions, the achievements reached at Camp David would not have been conceivable.
89.	Not only since the founding of the State of Israel but since the very beginning of the Zionist movement our dream has always been of a Middle East in which Jew and Arab would live in harmony and co-operation for the mutual advantage of both peoples.
90.	The Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is a step in this direction. It provides for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilian population from Sinai; for the establishment of normal relations between the two countries, including diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and full recognition; the termination of economic boycotts and of barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and mutual protection of citizens by due process of law. It also stipulates that there shall be free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, and that the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba are international waterways to be open to all nations for navigation and over flight.
91.	In view of the several wars launched by our neighbours, we are conscious of our security needs. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of normal relations between the two States, there will be security arrangements concerning the limitation of armaments and forces in the different areas on the basis of reciprocity.
92.	Moreover, the framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel also provides for the stationing of United Nations forces at Sham el Sheikh to ensure freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran. Similarly, there is a provision for their being stationed in northern Sinai, thus creating a ""buffer zone"" between the forces stationed in El-Arish and those in Gaza. These forces will not be removed unless such removal is approved by the Security Council of the United Nations. It should be noted here that in recent years the United Nations forces in the Middle East have played a constructive role with the framework of the various agreed arrangements in the. region.
93.	It has never been the wish of Israel to exercise control over the lives and activities of the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza.
94.	We want to live as equals with the Arab inhabitants of those areas. We want to live with them, not to replace them; but at the same time we do not regard ourselves as foreigners in those areas. The Israeli settlements in Judaea and Samaria and in the Gaza district are there as of right. It is inconceivable to us that Jews should be prohibited from settling and living in Judaea and Samaria, which are the heart of our homeland.
95.	We maintain our army positions in those areas in order to ensure the security of the population of Israel, the majority of whom live in the Mediterranean coastal area. The Israeli forces are there in order to protect Israel and not in order to interfere in the lives of the Arab inhabitants. Under the agreement for the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn from those areas once a self-governing authority is freely elected by their inhabitants. The Israeli defence forces will be redeployed in those areas and maintained for security purposes. The final status of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza and their relationship with their neighbours will be negotiated during a period of five years following the establishment of the self-governing authority.
96.	One of the subjects that will be discussed between the parties will undoubtedly be the question concerning Jerusalem. For us, the city of Jerusalem is the one and only eternal capital of Israel. We have not, and we shall never have, any other capital city, whether or not others recognize it as such. This eternal city is holy to three religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. However, our connexion with it is not just religious, but derives from the totality of Jewish national history. Jerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. It is now united once again, as it should be, free and open for all to come and go. All religious communities should be in complete control of their own holy places and of their own religious life, and all should enjoy the rights of free worship. The inhabitants of the city should live together in harmony with a representative municipal council supervising all essential functions. We have resolved never again to compromise the unity of Jerusalem, and it is our hope that other peoples will share our position.
97.	It was agreed at Camp David that a peace settlement in the Middle East should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council. Resolution 242(1967) is a carefully worked out set of principles establishing a framework of peace to be negotiated among the contending States. It makes clear mat the final borders must be negotiated bilaterally among the States concerned.
98 Let us hope that all those whose co-operation is essential in obtaining peace in the Middle East will not short-sightedly remain outside the peace process. We have to find agreed and appropriate ways for Jews and Arabs to live together in equality, trust and mutual respect.















"
5,1985,"ISR_prev_1998","Sir, at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for the fortieth session. I am convinced that your wealth of diplomatic experience and proven skills will contribute to the enrichment of the deliberations during this special session.
This year we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established with many hopes and expectations in the aftermath of a world distraught by death, destruction and the plunder of war.
Like many other peoples, but significantly different from them, the Jewish people underwent an ordeal which will leave its eternal mark not only in the long annals of its history but also in its deeper spiritual and psychological experience. This was, of course, the horrendous Holocaust which was wrought upon us by nazism and anti-semitism. For this reason the emergence of the United Nations provided a source of inspiration and light for us at the end of a very dark era in our history.
Indeed, what could be more stirring than the unequivocal declarations of principle appearing in the opening paragraphs of the United Nations Charter, such as: ""We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and the call ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors""? To my great regret, however, this Organization has had a part in shattering these aspirations and noble ideals.
The slander of anti-semitism has also been propagated in the guise of anti-zionism. In this context, we sadly note the tenth anniversary of the passing of the infamous General Assembly resolution falsely equating the Jewish National Liberation Movement - Zionism - with an outrageous phenomenon totally alien to the most fundamental and spiritual values of the Jewish heritage. That resolution, 3379 (XXX), of 10 November 1975, will be remembered in the history of the United Nations as a terrible blot on its record and a discredit to the Organization and to those irresponsible Members that supported it.
Other international forums have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda and political warfare against Israel, distorting the real purposes for which they were established. It would, therefore, be appropriate and timely to strive for what I would call ""political disarmament"" in these bodies, in order to guarantee that they maintain their integrity and credibility in the exercise of their legitimate functions.
Israel was established in 1948 against the background of a United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The United Nations, however, did nothing to implement its resolution, and the State of Israel came into being through the will, the toil and the sacrifice of its people. Nor, I might add, did the United Nations alleviate the immense threats and dangers that Israel had to face since its establishment.
Since the founding of the State we have made every possible effort towards the achievement of peace and the normalization of relations with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our national heritage. The Jewish people is a small, democratic and free people, striving to rebuild its renewed nationhood in its ancient homeland. We cherish peace and we teach its blessings to our children. Indeed, after a prolonged period of strife and hostility forced on us by our neighbors, we found a way to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
Egypt and Israel have demonstrated clearly that face-to-face negotiations and direct dialog are the most constructive and beneficial ways of achieving peace. This was brought about on the basis of the Camp David Accords, which established a just and effective framework for the settlement of conflicts. It is for this reason that Israel is so insistent on applying this framework to the further extension of the peace process. We hope that in the near future we shall be able to negotiate with Jordan, our neighbor to the East. It is crucial that the peace treaty with Egypt should not remain the sole example of peace with our neighbors, and therefore we earnestly seek to widen and deepen that peace by extending the process to include the rest of our Arab neighbors.
From this rostrum I once again urge King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct negotiations with Israel - not in some vague, deflecting international forum, but in direct, bilateral discussions. An international conference is a means of evading direct negotiations. It will be a stage for hostile and extreme propaganda and will not serve the cause of peace. Our aim should be the achievement of a bilaterally negotiated peace treaty between our countries. There is no change in our deep commitment to the Camp David accords, and we stand ready therefore to meet a Jordanian delegation, which may include Arab Palestinians from Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or other Arab Palestinians to be mutually agreed upon.
Israel firmly believes that there is no way to solve the problems of our region except through negotiations and peace. If King Hussein has finally decided to offer his hand in peace, let him act the way the late President Sadat did. He should not drown the quest for peace in a sea of conditions that nullify any chance of peace - conditions such as an international conference and the participation of terrorist organizations in the peace process. I should also like to urge King Hussein to free himself at this eleventh hour, from the clutches of the PLO. King Hussein has been caught in their clutches before and it seems that he has failed to learn from his own experience. Only after freeing himself from his dangerous association with the PLO terrorists will it be possible to achieve progress towards peace between Israel and Jordan. Indeed, the recent marked increase in terror attacks against Israelis stems, among other things, from Hussein's partnership with the PLO. Jordan cannot extend the olive branch of peace on the one hand and play host to terror at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.
Our position in this regard is clear and decisive. We are firmly against any contacts or dealings with terrorists or their representatives - and, in this case, with an organization whose declared purpose is the liquidation of Israel. PLO leaders have been intimating that they are engaged in the political process of peace. However, they have been waging cruel and murderous terrorist activity all along. According to their declared program, political action and terrorist activities should go hand in hand until they achieve their goal, the elimination of Israel. He are not ready to negotiate with terror. There is no place for its self-proclaimed representatives at a table where peace, security and tranquility are to be negotiated. Acknowledging that organization would be tantamount to legitimizing terror, and should be rejected by all those who value peace.
To protect our people and territory from terror, we were obliged to act against the PLO terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, which posed an intolerable threat to our people in the Galilee region.
Meanwhile, terror continues to wreak havoc in Lebanon. The latest outrage was the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats in Beirut. Kidnapping and the holding of hostages for ransom is only one of the manifestations of international terrorism, whose linchpin is the PLO, which we roust fight and stamp out. This is another example of the fact that terror knows no bounds, neither political nor any other.
The removal of the various threats from Israel's northern border continues to be an important priority for us. We will do all in our power to defend and protect the population of the north. This objective has become no less important in the wake of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanon, in accordance with the decision of the Government of Israel of 14 January 1935.
Yesterday Israel took action against terror bases, this time in Tunisia. Israel's air force acted against the terrorists only after it became evident that the terrorists were mounting attacks from Tunis with impunity. Only last week, PLO terrorists, who were directed and commanded from Tunis, attacked an Israeli boat in Larnaca, Cyprus, and murdered three Israeli civilians in cold blood. In recent months, those headquarters were responsible for a number of seaborne attempts
against our people, which were prevented by Israel's navy. We had no intention of attacking Tunisia, although that country has permitted terrorist bases to exist on its soil. We acted against murderous criminals in order to prevent the continuation of their criminal acts.
The United Nations has been sadly remiss in meeting the challenge of international and PLO terror. It could and should have come out resolutely against this evil phenomenon of our time and placed it outside the pale of civilization. Instead, it has equivocated and, worse, legitimized terror in terms that have provided encouragement to the terrorists and their supporters.
I regret to state that, in spite of numerous outrages and continuing attacks by PLO terrorists, this issue has never been seriously addressed by the Security Council or other United Nations and international forums. Israel cannot be expected to ignore this double standard. In spite of this, Israel is willing to act with other free nations to curb, if not stamp out, terrorism. Similarly, we urge joint international action against terrorists and their sponsors.
Among the most distressing and oppressing phenomena of our international experience is racism. The very word evokes dark and brutal memories of the long history of the Jewish people. Apartheid is a system of discrimination which the Jewish faith and the State of Israel totally reject and repudiate. The Government of Israel, on 11 August 1985, reiterated that it is unconditionally opposed to the policy of apartheid in South Africa and to any discrimination on grounds of race, religion or color or on any other grounds.
Israel has diplomatic relations with some of the African States and we are ready to renew our relations with those with which we do not have them. This is, of course, up to them. We believe that many have by now seen who the real friends of Africa are: it is not those who use high-flown words but will not lend a helping hand in time of need and distress, or those who remember Africa only when they need its votes at the United Nations. The State of Israel, in contrast, was one of the first to reach out to the nations of Africa, in their early years of sovereignty and statehood and in their current travails, and we are ready to increase our efforts.
In the area of disarmament the nations of the Middle Bast are confronted with three main challenges. These are the reduction of conventional arms, the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the eradication of the use. of chemical warfare. My Government believes that concerted regional action on all three issues is a moral imperative of the highest priority.
Concerning the accumulation of conventional arras, Israel voices its concern over the accelerated supply of large quantities of weapons to a number of belligerent Arab Governments in our region. These regimes do not need these arms for their defense, but are stockpiling them to use against Israel. This can only serve to undermine the chances for peace in the Middle East.
On the subject of nuclear weapons, we believe that the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation in so sensitive an area as the Middle Bast is a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, based on a system of obligations binding' on all States concerned. Israel stands ready to begin such negotiations without delay or preconditions.
While Israel is conscious of the necessity to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are also aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful use of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international agreements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
Another issue that arouses the deepest anxiety is the repeated use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and the danger that such use may spread in a manner that could not easily be reversed, if at all. It is tragic that the sixtieth anniversary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbidding the use of such weapons should be commemorated in this manner. This total disregard for solemn international legal obligations by Iraq demonstrates the difficulty of achieving genuine disarmament. But we must not despair; we must continue our efforts in this vital field of human endeavor.
The deteriorating situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union obliges us once again to speak out in defense of their elementary rights. Our concern relates especially to the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who have indicated their desire to join their people in Israel. The Soviet authorities, however, in flagrant violation of the Helsinki Final Act and many other international obligations assumed by the Soviet Government, refuse them permission to leave.
Many of those Jews who have been denied permission to leave are forced to live as outcasts from Soviet society, subject to all manner of official harassment and persecution, while being effectively deprived of the means of legal redress. Increasing numbers have been engulfed in recent months in an accelerating wave of arrests, trials and savage sentences of imprisonment on trumped-up criminal charges. Jews seeking to disseminate knowledge of the Hebrew language have been prominent among these recent victims of judicial repression. These Jews are in no way violating Soviet law, nor are they involved in any form of anti-Soviet activity. Their real crimes, in the eyes of the authorities, are their persistent demand to leave for Israel and their efforts, in the face of strenuous official opposition, to perpetuate their Jewish heritage, culture and religion.
All of these outrages are taking place against the background of a relentless campaign of anti-semitic incitement, usually camouflaged as anti-zionism, in the officially controlled media - a campaign designed by the authorities to encourage an attitude of suspicion, hatred and contempt towards Soviet Jews on the part of the Soviet population.
We call upon all persons of goodwill and all Governments in the civilized world to join us in our protests and in urging the Soviet authorities to conform their policies towards Soviet Jewry to the international obligations solemnly undertaken by the Soviet Government.
Israel seeks good relations with all States including, naturally, the Soviet Union. We have looked to the new Soviet leadership for signs of change in its attitude towards Soviet Jewry. Regrettably, so far we have seen no positive changes whatsoever. .We therefore have no choice but to continue to expose energetically and protest vigorously these flagrant violations of the rights of our fellow Jews seeking to join their people in Israel. He shall continue to do so untiA every Soviet Jew who so wishes is free to exercise this basic right.
There is also the problem of the Jews of Syria, who are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies and are not free to choose to live wherever they wish. This is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Syria is a signatory. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return.
Several hundred young Jewish women remain unmarried because of the depleted male Jewish population in Syria. The Syrian Government has cruelly refused to allow those women to leave the country in order to be able to marry within their faith and establish families.
tJe are also concerned about the small, ancient Jewish community left in Ethiopia, because of its isolation and suffering and the latest disasters that have befallen that country. Some of these Jews have already returned to their historic homeland and have been received as long-lost brothers and sisters who have finally returned home.
The people of Israel and its Government have expressed their solidarity with the Ethiopian people, which has undergone much suffering as a result of the recent famine and other difficulties. We appeal to the Ethiopian Government to respect the cultural and religious rights of the Jewish community and to enable it to continue to maintain its heritage and religion and, on humanitarian grounds, to permit those among them who so desire to be reunited with their families in Israel.
The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations may be a fitting occasion for a review and reappraisal of its activities, in frank and constructive self-criticism.
The United Nations should not merely celebrate its past but also plan for its future.
Some may feel disheartened by the fact that, after so many years of United Nations preoccupation with the problems of the developing countries, we still remain so distant from the goal of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich nations of the world. Poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease still characterize the conditions of life in many parts of the world.
One inescapable conclusion is that progress has too often been hampered by a tendency to substitute slogans for serious plans of action. Meeting the world's pressing economic and social problems will require new dimensions of international co-operation. The danger of famine continues to afflict developing countries. There is dire need for urgent action by the world community. The peoples of Africa are struggling to free themselves from the curses of poverty and hunger, and the rest of the world must help them in this struggle.
The vital element of developing traditional agriculture has been sorely neglected. Israel is now preparing an aid proposal for more efficient food delivery systems that would provide better nutrition and would link such aid with land and water development programs.
The success of integrated rural development has been proved in Israel's own rapid agricultural development. Israel has much experience in the proper use of soil and water, marketing organization, agro-industrial systems appropriate for developing countries, and the integration of populations and development projects. He are ready to share our know-how in these fields with other developing countries. The benefits of this experience can contribute to raising living standards in many societies.	4
Israel has presented to international organizations, both within and outside the United Nations, a development proposal entitled ""Transitional Economy"". It seeks to break the vicious circle of poverty by improving the productivity and quality of life in developing countries. The proposed program seeks to combine a comprehensive development process with decentralized planning and implementation.
In the 26 years of Israel's involvement in international development efforts, Israel has co-operated with more than 100 countries and trained over 50,000 men and women in agriculture, in rural development and in health and education. During Israel's development it encountered some of the same problems that are now facing African countries and has successfully overcome them.
The United Nations may recapture some of its prestige and authority if it gives priority to these pressing social and economic issues. The magnitude of the tasks before us will require unprecedented international co-operation.
Unfortunately, the United Nations record is not very encouraging. At its last session the General Assembly had 143 items on its agenda. It passed no less than 38 resolutions relating to the Middle East, out of which 37 were negative, even hostile, in their reference to Israel. Such resolutions have long ceased to attract any attention or carry any weight. Yet the General Assembly did not see fit to address itself to such danger-spots as the Iraq-Iran war and Afghanistan, or to many of the socio-economic problems which plague our society.
Let us put aside the political differences that beset our world and join forces in an effort to find solutions for the ordinary man, woman and child, who are too often ignored in the heat of political debate. Let us work together in the spirit of the ancient prophets who gave to the world the concept of the brotherhood of man, a concept which has been the basis for the great ideals of mankind.
In the present age of unprecedented opportunities, Israel calls upon all Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations to rise to the challenge offered by science and technology. Let us share the fruits of scientific and technological advances to improve our lives. Let us build a moral and prosperous future to achieve justice and dignity for all. Let the United Nations become, truly, a ""United Nations for a better world""."

unanimous election as President of the General Assembly
at its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I
would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas
do Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried
out his duties.
The succession of Governments, which is a defining
principle of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to
power a new Government in Israel. A section of the
international community has deemed this democratic Israeli
choice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against
regional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to
make a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for
peace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers
on one side and mischief-makers and people who reject
peace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right
converge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and
differences notwithstanding.
I wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab
peace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding
the practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new
majority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve
peace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding
landmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The
Madrid Conference, to which I had the honour of
contributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of
peace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are
the direct heirs.
The firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government
with respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the
peace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and
Jordan, helped to shape. However, my Government’s swift
engagement in the peace process has been minimized,
reduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel
and I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian
Authority have been met with sarcasm and given only
secondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely
with the substance and the content of peace. They
initiated the ways and means necessary for the
achievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of
the Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian
recognition to new sections of society and Israeli political
classes. It is Israel’s determination to reach peace
according to the policies and fundamental guidelines of
the new Government.
On its road to peace, the Government of Israel is
guided by several principles, which I would like to
expound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a
blind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a
region where, unfortunately, threats and instability still
rage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture
of peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along
behind a process in which terrorism and violence have not
yet spoken their last word.
Negotiations themselves, through their joint creative
energies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The
battle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its
sources of financing and assistance is not only for us to
fight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations
relentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It
is imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process free from violence.
I have just returned from the Washington summit,
held at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of
the Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this
rostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State
of the United States for their exemplary contribution to
peace by bringing the parties together and for their
profound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.
In this respect the role and contribution of the United
States remain of great importance.
On Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will
convene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in
respect of the various agreements. We are responsible to
our people and to our whole region in this matter. We
must therefore display good faith and mutual
understanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send
out the message of stable peace and lasting security.
12


The Washington summit reconfirmed the principles
and guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself
wholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-
to-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the
key to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the
renunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of
mutual efforts for peace.
The choice is in our hands. Will we opt for
cooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we
revert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and
violence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,
Israel has chosen hope.
Another major principle in our search for peace is the
will of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.
Regional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace
and stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic
hegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of
regional cooperation. This is a basic principle of
normalization. Peace and normalization are one and
indivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of
peace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization
taken hostage and brought to a halt.
Israel makes no secret that normalization of its
relations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.
This means comprehensive political and economic relations,
and the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual
acceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a
body foreign to the region. Normalization must erase
forever the residue of this ideological negation.
Normalization is the indispensable cement for keeping
together the edifice of peace.
One of our immediate goals is the resumption of
negotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid
principles, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two
countries. We recognize Syria’s important role in the
establishment of lasting peace in our region. From this
rostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume
negotiations.
As to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with
Lebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon
can be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and
the building of peace.
Egypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our
partners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have
always been engaged in all stages of the peace process.
Jordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the
building of peace in our region. A man of peace and
dialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively
supported the peace process and has provided a vital
guarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed
his complete support.
On the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,
the country of my birth and family roots, has always
walked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab
reconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King
Hassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-
Israeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his
essential role and breathe into peace the remarkable
inspiration of his solidarity.
I would like to pay tribute also to the active support
of Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania
have all helped to consolidate peace efforts.
The peace process has benefitted from the
considerable support of the co-sponsors, the United States
and Russia, and from the active and positive contribution
of the European Union and Norway and of Powers such
as Japan and Canada.
Once again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’s
irreversible commitment and determination to pursue the
path of peace.
Since the dawn of history our region has been a
meeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a
vibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the
crossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East
must, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this
place and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs
and Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to
regenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and
humanity.
Through international cooperation, Israel is sharing
with young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin
America to China, its achievements and assets in the
fields of agriculture, health and science.
We hope that the day will come when a regional
security system will be established in the Middle East to
provide a cooperative multilateral response to all security
problems. The advantage of this regional approach is that
it is based on direct negotiations between the States of the
region. The first stage is to build confidence, and
thereafter we must put arms control and disarmament
13


mechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the
establishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security
Working Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope
that in the future this framework will encompass all States
of the Middle East.
Israel’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set
ambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and
realistically. After peace and reconciliation have been
established among all the States of the region, Israel will
endeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as
ballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to
rigorous verification.
Negotiations to establish such a zone will commence
following the signing of bilateral peace accords between
Israel and all the countries of the region. In the meantime
Israel will implement confidence-building measures that
will increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make
a contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed
conflict.
We generally prefer regional security arrangements.
However, Israel is in favour of the implementation of
certain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control
and disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel
signed the Convention on conventional weapons and
adopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of
anti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty
against the use of chemical weapons and now the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will
consider ratification of that Treaty depending upon
developments in the region, particularly the adoption of that
Treaty by the major countries.
Israel has thus demonstrated its determination to be
involved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the
international community to prevent the spread of
conventional and non-conventional weapons.
Israel strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged
member of the family of nations represented in this
Organization. We note with regret and deep disappointment
that the question of our membership in a regional group has
still not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right
available to all States Members of the United Nations to
participate on an equal footing in all its activities. This
impairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations
under the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this
injustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able
to act within this Organization on the same footing as all
other Member States.
It is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name
is invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to
conclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great
religions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and
ensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression
for all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality
to which Israel has made a profound contribution.
Jerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,
has throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the
summit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in
ancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the
capital of any country other than Israel.
Rarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied
the right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people
of peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,
has returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:
Jerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving
devotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of
peace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shall
tirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.




"
5,1997,"ISR_prev_1998","I would like to begin by
congratulating the President on his unanimous election to
preside over the fifty-second session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this
session the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations
closer to each other and in finding ways to address the
challenges that face all countries and nations, north and
south, east and west.
I also wish to congratulate his predecessor,
Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in
which he carried out his duties.
We mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the
peace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,
Menachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar
Sadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their
courageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first
peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.
Throughout their entire history, the people of Israel
have aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant
call for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any
effort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,
a partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek
channels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.
In recent years, since 1991, after the principles for
negotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at
Madrid, we have achieved a number of important
advances with the establishment of full peace between
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the
signing of interim accords with the Palestinians.
Nevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and
negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and
Lebanon still lie ahead of us.
Immediately after the last elections, the Government
of Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the
Oslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the
past year we have spared no effort to implement those
accords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood
of the entire process has been undermined as a result of
the failure of the Palestinians to carry out their
commitments according to the agreements they have
signed.
In the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we
have endured many tests and have suffered ongoing
terrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration
for peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the
shedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,
women and children cut down by barbaric terrorist
attacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over
the loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has
not been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of
Israel.
The citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves
great risks for peace, but there is none among them who
is willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being
demanded in the name of peace. We must break this
tragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in
confronting the terror that trust will be re-established and
the doubts regarding intentions be removed.
As I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of
this Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for
peace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both
right and left are united in this quest.
If trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity
is honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We
have already proved our willingness to do so, through our
decisions and actions since taking office and in the
signing and implementation of the Hebron agreement in
all its aspects.
Peace cannot live side by side with continued
incitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in
essence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of
25


violence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the
honouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.
These principles apply throughout the world and must
apply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel
tracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a
second track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues
unimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct
challenge and affront to the very concept of peace.
Terror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not
a spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen
terrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of
innocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare
organizations, while under this cover they contribute to the
preparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.
Terror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any
moment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie
in its path.
Those who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill
Israelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be
accepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It
must be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must
be fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its
constant threat.
The words of the President of the United States and of
the Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few
days ago are important and should guide us all in this
matter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this
very rostrum:
“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable
political act.” [See Official Records of the General
Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th
meeting]
Thus, the international community bears the responsibility
for ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,
recognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.
In the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority
and Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the
Palestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this
commitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again
one year ago at the Washington summit and again in the
Hebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been
proved that this commitment has not been upheld as
required, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.
Israel stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian
Authority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against
terror. The Authority must act jointly and in full
cooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We
seek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the
implementation of signed agreements. The fight against
terror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian
interest.
In response to the repeated crises in the process
caused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live
up to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of
conduct for relations between us. This code should
include, first, the rejection of violence as a means for
achieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the
framework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain
from attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto
the international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of
permanent channels of communication, including in times
of crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call
to violence and jihad, and their replacement with the
language of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,
the advancement and encouragement of normalization and
support for regional activities.
The purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate
uninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to
create an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond
to the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe
that the adoption of the above principles will allow us to
overcome the present crisis and help in preventing future
ones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game
will also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders
and greater confidence between the peoples.
In the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the
United States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has
been reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace
process to its proper track. We have been conducting
intensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the
United States, both in Washington and here, with a view
to resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to
reach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.
Israel values and appreciates the action of the United
States Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts
to extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to
bring the parties closer together and to ensure the success
of the negotiations. We are fully committed to these
efforts.
26


Israel reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated
negotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on
permanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in
which the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and
the way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended
to hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to
delay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the
Palestinian Authority.
The international community can play an important
role in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which
will make it possible for us to resolve our differences
through direct negotiations. It is only through direct
negotiations that we can bring this process to a successful
conclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or
pressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the
dispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the
United Nations and other international forums only serve to
create unnecessary obstacles and to make already
entrenched positions more rigid.
The comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be
achieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and
Lebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and
agreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to
resolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to
find in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for
a just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in
favour of peace — the “peace of the brave”, as claimed by
its leadership — then we must explore together every
possible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing
the talks between us.
Israel cannot accept the continued violence and terror
on its northern border. The terrorist activities of
organizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha
rockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the
threat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.
There is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.
We wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon
acting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that
operate from its territory.
If we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only
with agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means
normalization, open borders, freedom of movement,
commerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire
region. These are the soul and essence of peace.
Normalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.
The decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab
League at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week
ago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for
peace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to
prevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of
existing relations with it, to close liaison and interests
offices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to
reactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a
boycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which
is reversing the process.
The ongoing and intentional freeze of the
multilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the
entrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant
and should serve as a platform and incentive for building
peace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral
channels alike and not make one conditional upon the
other, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road
to peace. The question mark hanging over the regional
economic conference scheduled to take place later this
year in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative
drive.
The countries of the Middle East that are party to
the peace effort have a common interest in regional
stability and the advancement of prosperity and well-
being for all the nations of the region. We face together
the growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding
desert. We are also facing dangers from within our region
that threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of
various nations and to plunge the entire region into
violence, war and bloodshed.
It was only a few years ago that the entire world
was forced into forming a coalition to combat an
aggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring
country and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face
new and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of
recent experience have not been learned and many
countries turn a blind eye to the threat.
The leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms
that threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.
Yet the international community continues to remain deaf
and refuses to speak out against Iran's policies,
declarations and actions.
Iran's efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire
operational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds
represent the greatest threat to security and stability in the
Middle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran's
weapons programme extend far beyond the geographical
confines of our region. They threaten the security of other
27


members of the international community and their interests.
Israel reiterates its call to the members of the
international family of nations — and at their head the
United States, Russia and the members of the European
Union and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —
to exercise the full weight of their influence and to take
concrete steps to prevent this development, which
represents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.
After the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties
between Israel and every country of the region, it will be
possible to create a regional security system that would
provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of
security problems in the Middle East, including a mutually
and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These
are our goals and we must act to achieve them.
Israel is an active and responsible member of the
family of nations represented in this body. However, 50
years after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November
1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the
State of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this
Organization.
We attach great importance to the fundamental reform
of the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of
other United Nations Member countries that believe that the
Organization urgently requires greater efficiency and a
redirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its
truly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced
that no reform can be completed so long as the question of
Israel's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.
We call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.
Much to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an
intensification of the political campaign waged against
Israel at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes
the peace process and further undermines confidence
between the parties. We call upon the Member States to
refrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The
time has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of
resolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and
to contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive
to direct negotiations between the parties.
As part of Israel's international and regional
commitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in
cooperative programmes with many countries, with which
we share the experience and knowledge we have acquired
in various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its
international cooperation programme and to assisting
various peoples to address the challenges of development
and the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.
Over more than three decades, tens of thousands of
trainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their
own countries within the framework of Israel's
cooperation and assistance programme in the fields of
education, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and
leadership. We are especially proud of the participation in
recent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst
them Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of
goodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the
message and the great hope of human well-being. As in
the words of the prophet:
“Each shall help his neighbour and make him
strong”.
This year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the
world marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years
ago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in
its ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our
2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we
would renew our national life in the land of our
forefathers, the land of Israel.
It is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this
aspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its
land. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its
ancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant
and democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,
research and industry.
For the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure
Israel's security and independence, while always seeking
peace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty
years on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.
This week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish
new year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye
towards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the
peace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of
hope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the
shofar is accompanied by the prayer:
“may the year and its troubles pass and a new year
and its blessings begin”.




"
5,1971,"ISR_prev_1998","60.	 Mr. President, you come to the leadership of the General Assembly at a time when eastern Asia stands in the center of international concern. It is in that region alone that war still rages day by day. It is there that a burden of suffering, unparalleled elsewhere, weighs heavily on the conscience of mankind. And it is to Asia that our eyes will turn when we come to take decisions on the future of this Organization and the principles underlying its structure.
61.	It is right at such a time that an Asian statesman of high capacity and repute should preside over our deliberations. Israel wishes you success and pledges itself to your support. You will be fortified by the high example of your eminent predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, and by the experience and patient skill of the Secretary-General, who is completing a full decade of service to the international cause.
62.	Last year the United Nations marked its twenty-fifth anniversary by an act of celebration. I suggested then that the occasion could have been more wisely used for scrutiny and self-criticism (1851st meeting]. There is a manifest decline in the influence of the General Assembly on the main issues affecting human welfare and destiny. Its resonance has diminished. The central currents of international life and policy flow outside its walls. The frustration arises, not so much from defects in the Organization's work, as from discord and contention amongst the Powers. Yet there are some causes which lie within our capacity of correction. I shall mention one.
63.	In the work of the United Nations there is a strong accent on public controversy and a relative neglect of private conciliation. A report by the Secretary-General 11 years ago contained a plea to give greater emphasis to the United Nations as an instrument for negotiation of settlements as distinct from this world debate of issues. The advice was not heeded. Debate, not negotiation, still dominates the United Nations practice. Resolutions are adopted in great numbers, but their texts bear witness to the parliamentary advantages of fragmentation rather than to a balanced view of rights or realities.
64.	For example: in a dispute in the Middle East between two parties one of which has a single vote and the other 16 or, in practice 40, the preordained triumph of automatic majorities has no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory. The same is true of the Security Council, a third of whose members have their diplomatic relations and their ethnic or sentimental predilections exclusively on one side.
65.	This difficulty would not exist if the organs of the United Nations would regard it as their main function to seek consensus which would include the interested parties. They would be better employed in encouraging agreement between the parties at issue, than in sharpening controversy between them by attempts at adjudication. In short, the United Nations should aspire to a diplomatic rather than to a parliamentary role. The test of achievement should be not how many resolutions we have voted but how many solutions we have advanced.
66.	And, indeed, wherever free, direct negotiation has taken place across the world in the past year there has been fruitful issue. There have been the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, based, as Mr. Gromyko significantly told us, ""on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers"" [1942nd meeting, para. 101]. He was referring to the frontiers established after the war by negotiation and agreement. There has been the four-Power agreement on Berlin where, as Mr. Gromyko again correctly said, it is now up to the two parties directly concerned ""to complete the negotiations between them"" [ibid., para. 98]. There has been the normalization of relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been direct contact between the United States and the People's Republic of China, to be followed at an early date by a meeting at the highest level of responsibility. The Paris talks on Viet-Nam, with the direct participation of all the parties at issue, have been accompanied by a constant de-escalation of the fighting. There is grave tension between India and Pakistan, as is evident from the general debate here earlier this week; but the two Governments have direct relations which they ca« apply to the solution of their differences. Many hearts are heavy at the reports coming from the boundary between Ireland and
Northern Ireland; but there is also news that the heads of Government concerned have met each other and agreed on a process of political reconciliation. In Washington, agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are being signed today for modernizing the ""hot line"" and strengthening safeguards against accidental war.
67.	Is there no lesson to be drawn from the settlements reached and attempted this year? Surely they show that the air is alive with a spirit of innovation. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to be an organic part of our generation's life are now yielding to a strong impulse for peaceful settlement. Above all we are learning lessons about the immense importance of communication. Time and again the decision of Governments to abandon their cold separation and make contact with each other develops from a procedural advance into a change of substantive positions and thence into binding agreements. The central themes of international life in 1971 are direct contact, the abandonment of traditional conflicts, and flexible, pragmatic negotiation.
68.	There is also a move away from dogmatic attachment to documents. If old formulas and texts have reached deadlock, new ones are sought. There is a particular recognition that after wars the need is to build new systems of relations and not to reproduce the conditions and situations out of which war erupted. This new empiricism affects the juridical domain as well. Governments which seriously seek peace do not hesitate to confer directly with Governments which they do not yet recognize and with which they have no legal relations,
69.	If there is frustration in the Middle East it is because our region is still the exception to all the positive rules which have been applied elsewhere. Whatever is tried successfully in other regions is avoided in the Middle East. Here alone there is still no contact between the parties at issue. Here alone the Governments which will have to live side by side with each other have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. Here alone we are often told that the only way to get peace is to restore the situations which erupted in war. Here alone it is said in many places that the resumption of an important peace mission is wholly dependent on a single memorandum on which there is deadlock, and that there is no room for any innovation or any versatility of formulas and techniques.
70.	It is true, despite these failures, that the situation in the Middle East today is less explosive than a year ago. The flow of events has not been backward. The cease-fire along the Suez Canal has been effective, with rare and isolated exceptions, for 14 months. Israel does not propose to bring it to an end and Egypt would achieve nothing by violating it. Indeed, the only certainty in the Middle East is that resumed hostilities would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The absence of fighting along the Suez Canal line has released the Middle East and the world from the daily prospect of escalation involving the Soviet forces which were irresponsibly introduced into the' region with the effect of aggravating and enlarging a local tension. There has been a sharp decline in the strength and prestige of the terrorist groups and the pirate organizations that loomed so large a year ago. There has been peaceful movement across open bridges into Israel and the administered territories of scores of thousands of Arabs from neighboring Arab countries which are officially ""at war"" with Israel. Thus new patterns of coexistence have grown up between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in daily life and work. Side by side with a violent and incendiary Arab rhetoric there seem to be here and there some beginnings of a greater realism in Arab thinking on the problem of Israel's sovereignty and Israel's deep roots in the life and history of the Middle East. Finally, there are three separate availabilities of good offices which, although not all in active course today, are mutually accepted by the parties: the Jarring mission; the good offices of the United States in pursuit of an agreement concerning the Suez Canal; and the intention of ten African Presidents to authorize four eminent heads of State to go to Jerusalem and Cairo on a mission of information and goodwill.
71.	Yet, with all these consolations the peace efforts are not sufficiently intense. The talks under Ambassador Jarring's auspices, which began in high promise in January, have been at a standstill since the end of February. An exchange of views and positions on a special Suez Canal agreement was inaugurated through the good offices of the United States in April. This effort is still underway, but its pace is slow. In discussing the obstacles to peace it would be easy, but sterile, to fall into recrimination. Nothing would be easier. One of the few things that all Members of the United Nations have in common is the ability to discuss each other's imperfections. Yet what mankind longs to hear is not how deadlocks arose, but how it is proposed to overcome them. The general debate will be well used if Middle Eastern States will give precise definition to what they are prepared to do in order to bring a peaceful settlement into view. All who seek an understanding of Israel's policies must come face to face with two elements in the national mood. There is a sharp preoccupation with security; and there is a vivid memory of the horror and dark peril from which we emerged four years ago.
72.	In reflecting on the theme of security, Israel cannot easily forget the immense loss and burden it has borne through the hostility directed against it for over two decades. Our danger, in 1967 was the climax, but not the whole story, of our predicament. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual survival. Israel's insistence on genuine and stable security takes particular depth from the hideous legacy of Jewish massacre in the European slaughter-house. No people in history has undergone an experience of such tragic depth and scope. And no other State has grown for 23 years amidst such a comprehensive effort to deny it every breath of life.
73.	In particular, Israel's mind preserves a permanent and,, unfading image of the danger and solitude from which it emerged in the summer of 1967. To forget or ignore these memories is to renounce all true understanding of the Middle Eastern reality today. It was only by exceptional vigilance and cruel sacrifice that we repelled a monstrous design that would have ended our people's historic journey and cast all Israel's life and achievement into the flames. Maritime blockade, terrorist incursions, military encirclement, declarations of overt war, a frenzied torrent of threats and a formal announcement from Cairo that the battle was joined for Israel's destruction all these came
together in cumulative assault,""We recall the outrageous silence and apathy with which the Security Council, between one adjournment and the next, calmly observed the only attempt in modern history to wipe a sovereign State off the map of the world. Mr. Gromyko indulges his sense of humour when he tells us that guarantees by the Security Council are among ""the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world"" [ibid.., para. 135], The truth has Iden and is that, largely as a result of Soviet policy, the Security Council for 20 years has refused to defend any Israeli right including the right not to have its citizens killed, its ports blockaded, its existence threatened. The policy of the Security Council has been to refuse to adopt any decision of which a single word is unpalatable to the Arab Governments. It has thus surrounded every assault on Israeli lives, Israeli rights and Israeli security with indulgence. At the highest point of tension and of Israel's danger in May 1967, with Israel blockaded and encircled on every side, with all mankind gripped by the apprehension of approaching war, the suggestion of the Soviet Union was that the Security Council should go home and refuse to discuss such an ""artificial"" matter as the declaration of active war and the formal imposition of a blockade against a Member State. It is largely because of Soviet policy that the Security Council cannot be a guarantor of any Israeli rights. And the future development in the composition of the Security Council, however essential for other reasons, is bound to emphasize its inability to guarantee or even to express an Israeli interest, whatever the majority of its members may think or say.
74.	There are few effective guarantees of peace beyond those inherent in the nature of the peace itself. The greatest danger is lest through lassitude of spirit or impatience or imprecision of diplomatic craftsmanship we again revert to fragile, false and ambiguous solutions, which carry in them the seed of future wars.
75.	But the work of peace, however complex, must be attempted. Israel's deepest aspiration is to take part in a new deployment of energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East. Accordingly I ask the crucial questions: Is the slow rhythm of the peace efforts inevitable? Can nothing be done or at least attempted to set some dialog in swifter motion? Do Israel's policies offer openings through which roads to peace can be discerned and actively explored? My answer is that if the Arab States, and especially Egypt, sincerely desire an honorable and lasting peace, there are many roads leading to that goal.
76.	The first road lies in a Suez Canal agreement. There are many reasons for giving priority to this at attempt. A sudden transition from a conflict of more than two decades to a total settlement has proved difficult. It may be more rational to expect progress by stages. Each stage would bring about a solution of a specific problem while opening the way to further agreements and thus to final peace.
77.	The Suez Canal sector calls urgently for disengagement. It is there that the regional tension is compounded by the military presence of a great Power. Disengagement of forces here is an urgent international interest.
78.	The President of Egypt proposed on 4 February an attempt to open the Suez Canal ahead of a total settlement.
Israel's Prime Minister responded on 9 February. Both Governments subsequently agreed that the United States should use its good offices to explore the prospect. We therefore have an agreed objective and an agreed modality. , We believe that the effort to bridge the gulf between the positions of the parties should be pursued in the general interest of peace. If agreement cannot be reached on such a clearly defined issue in which Egyptian advantage is so strong it would appear to be even more difficult to advance in one step towards an over-all settlement in which all the complex issues would Ml into place. But the contrary is also true. A concrete result in this matter will accelerate and inspire negotiation and agreements on other issues. The peace effort will acquire momentum. It will be surrounded for the first time by an air of confidence and promise.
79.	Having been invited to give its views on this matter, Israel developed a proposal that an arrangement be agreed upon with a view to the opening of the Suez Canal to be cleared and operated by Egypt. Israel would make a withdrawal of its forces from the water-line to an agreed distance. The fighting would not be resumed. Egypt would clear and open the Canal. It would be agreed that there be free passage for all ships and cargoes, including those of Israel. Effective and agreed supervision procedures would be established. Means of deterrence against the danger of violation of the agreement would be assured. The agreement would stand on its own feet, but it would not affect or annul the undertakings which the parties gave in August 1970 to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in conformity with his mandate under Security Council resolution 242(1967). The line to be held by Israeli forces in accordance with that Canal agreement would not be considered final. When agreement on a final boundary is reached in the framework of the peace settlement Israeli forces will withdraw to it.
80.	We hope that Egypt will give this proposal the detailed and careful consideration which seemed to be its intention in April. It represents far-reaching concessions on Israel's part. It involves a movement from the cease-fire line ahead of peace. It mitigates the accepted legitimate principle that no withdrawal need take place ahead of a contractual and mutually agreed peace. The prestige, benefits and revenues from the Canal, the possible return of three quarters of a million people who live near the Canal in peaceful times, as well as the crossing of the Canal by Egyptian civilian personnel, would all be Egyptian, not Israeli, gains. A new impetus would be given to the Jarring mission, which is now in abeyance. The undertakings which I have given refute the idoa that the Canal agreement would be the last word. On the contrary, its conclusion and observance would create a favorable channel for further agreements.
81.	It is true that neither Egypt nor Israel would attain its final objective in this interim framework, but Egypt's right to present its claims in the over-all peace negotiations would remain intact, as would Israel's freedom to present its own proposals and reservations.
82.	A second road to peace lies through the resumption of negotiations under Ambassado. Jarring's auspices. Israel agreed to resume these talks in January 1971 despite Egypt's refusal to rectify its violation of the missile- standstill agreement. At a meeting with the Prime Minister and myself in January, Ambassador Jarring was requested to communicate to the Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon a list of principles which, in our view, should be embodied in the peace agreements to be concluded and signed between Israel and each of the Arab Governments concerned. These principles were, at first, vehemently ""ejected by the Egyptian Government. Subsequently, on i 5 February, the Government of Egypt commented f A/8541, annex II] on an aide-memoir submitted a week before by Ambassador Jarring [A/8541, annex I], It did not accept Mr. Jarring's precise formulations on navigation in the Suez Canal, on the Straits of Tiran, nor indeed on the definition of the scope of withdrawal. But the Egyptian reply did contain an expression of readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that all the Egyptian terms for the agreement were met. One of these terms was the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip and all territories beyond the armistice line existing on 4 June 1967.
83.	In its reply on 26 February 1971 [A/8541, annex III] the Israel Government viewed favorably the expression by Egypt of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and reiterated that it was prepared for meaningful negotiation on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.
84.	Why then are the Jarring talks in abeyance? The reason is plain. The Security Council resolution, 242(1967), requires that the withdrawal and boundary clauses of the peace agreement, like all its other provisions, must be determined through agreement, which of course implies negotiation. Egypt declines to hold any dialog or negotiation whatever on this point. It lays down its own position as an ultimate condition to which Israel must submit before negotiation begins. Indeed it is not clear why negotiation would be needed at all if the Egyptian view has to be accepted in advance. In a recent declaration of which President Sadat was a signatory, three Arab Governments, including that of Egypt, reiterated that there can be no negotiation with Israel, no conciliation and no bargaining over the Palestinian issue. This is a more recent and presumably more authoritative statement of Egypt's policy than the one that Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Mr. Jarring six months ago. Together with other declarations in the same mood and spirit, it raises the question whether the February memorandum has the significance that we chose to attach to it at that time.
85.	But on one point alone the February communication from Cairo and the Damascus tripartite statement are one: they both rule out the free, precise and detailed negotiation of the ""boundary and withdrawal questions. Our policy is that, instead of cease-fire lines or armistice lines, we should establish secure, recognized and agreed boundaries as part of the peace-making process, and withdraw our armed forces to those boundaries once they are determined. It is important to break away from the temporary and unresolved territorial concepts which have prevailed since 1948 in order to develop for the first time a permanent structure of boundaries and security agreements.
86.	There is no need to be apologetic about the doctrine that peace boundaries may be different from armistice lines. The Arab Governments wrote into the 1949 Armistice Agreements a provision stating that the armistice lines are not the final boundaries and these must be worked out by agreement in the transition to peace. We are now embarked on that transition. Israel's size and strength are smaller than those of the European Powers which insisted on secure and agreed boundaries after the Second World War; but the right to negotiate boundaries that would release Israel from a chronic and desperate vulnerability belongs to it as to every other sovereign State. In this matter we are not in a position of juridical defense.
87.	I shall summarize under three headings the reasons and justifications which give Israel the right to have negotiation on boundaries and security arrangements. The first, as I have already pointed out, is the provisional character of the lines now held as well as those which existed before. Several years before the 1967 war the Deputy Foreign Minister of Egypt correctly said: ""There is no legal boundary between Israel and Egypt but only a line that was fixed in the pursuance of the Armistice Agreement.""
88.	On 31 May 1967 the representative of Jordan said in the Security Council:
""There is an Armistice Agreement. The Agreement did not fix boundaries; it fixed a demarcation line. The Agreement did not pass judgment on rights political, military or otherwise. Thus I know of no territory; I know of no boundary."" 
89.	A second and more contemporary reason in support of Israel's claim to a negotiation on withdrawal and boundaries lies in the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which has been accepted by some Arab States and by Israel and which is the constitutive document of the Jarring mission. That resolution was adopted after all attempts to require a withdrawal to the 4 June armistice lines had been defeated by vote or discarded for lack of support. The term ""secure and recognized boundaries"" was an innovation in the United Nations vocabulary. It first appeared in a United States draft resolution submitted on 7 November 1967 and later embodied in a United Kingdom draft  which was presented for unanimous vote. I must state with full solemnity and knowledge that Israel's adherence to the Security Council resolution and acceptance of the Jarring mission were secured on the most explicit understanding that the resolution offered an opportunity to negotiate agreements on boundaries and withdrawal. Secretary of State Rogers stated for the United States in October 1969:
""Those boundaries were armistice lines not final political borders. The rights, claims and positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were reserved by the Armistice Agreements. The Security Council resolution neither endorses nor precludes those armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.""
90.	In a public statement on 12 July 1970, Mr. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, declared that he had taken an active part in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). He added:
""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre- June 5 lines. The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""
91.	The United Kingdom Government, which sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967), put itself on record on 17 November 1969, when its Foreign Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, was asked:
""What is the British interpretation of the wording of the 1967 resolution? Does... it... mean that the Israelis should withdraw from all territories taken in the late war? ""
He replied:
""No, Sir. That is not the phrase used in the resolution. The resolution speaks of secure and recognized boundaries. Those words must be read concurrently with the statement on withdrawal."" 
A month later, on 9 December 1969, in the House of Commons he said:
""... There is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""?
I repeat: ""... the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""
92.	It was in the light of these clear undertakings that the Israel Government informed Mr. Jarring in August 1970 that it accepted the Security Council resolution 242 (1967) for implementation in all its parts and that on the establishment of a just and final peace in accordance with the resolution it would withdraw its forces from the cease-fire lines to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the negotiations.
93.	The political and juridical aspects of the questions to which I have referred are the expression^ a deeper, more concrete reality. Israel does not have a policy of expansion or annexation. In the negotiations on boundaries and withdrawals it will seek those modifications which are essential to ensure security and to prevent another war.
94.	ihe war of 1967 did not arise exclusively from the vulnerability of the armistice lines. But there is no doubt that some topographical and strategic situations were a permanent temptation to assault. If they are not corrected and adjusted Israel, on withdrawing from the cease-fire lines, would find itself again in a position of intolerable vulnerability. There could be no more horrifying error than to revert, through lack of precise and detailed negotiation, to a territorial structure and security balance capable of reproducing the peril which exploded four years ago.
95.	In the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai peninsula or even in most of it. But there are vital interests affecting security, peace and navigation which impel us to reserve the right to attempt in the peace negotiations to secure a contractual basis for such continued presence as is necessary to protect security and navigation. There are several juridical expressions and precedents for such an arrangement. Our emphasis is on practical security conditions, not on any particular juridical formula. The post-war map of the world is replete with instructive parallels. The peace treaties in Europe and Asia did not bring about a return to the exact military and territorial dispositions that existed before.
96.	Now Israel does not ask Egypt to accept any of its positions as a condition of negotiation. The proposal for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops to the previous positions is legitimate as an Egyptian proposal. It is equally legitimate for Israel to insist on an opportunity of free negotiation in which its own reservations and counter-proposals could be made. And our request from the world community is modest. We do not present specific Israeli proposals for endorsement by other Governments; we ask only that our right to negotiate the issues vital to our future, to our peace and to our security, should not be cut off in advance.
97.	Our position, then, is this: We have taken note of the Egyptian proposal on withdrawal. Israel would withdraw its armed forces from the Israel-United Arab Republic ceasefire line to the secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in the peace agreement. Now that both parties have presented their basic positions, they should pursue their negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior condition to cover all the points I listed in their respective documents with a view to concluding a peace agreement. I continue to adhere to the view which I expressed at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly in October 1968 that
""It is possible to work out a boundary settlement compatible with the security of Israel and the honor of
Arab States	The majority of the United Nations have
recognized that the only durable and reasonable solutions are agreed solutions serving the common interests of our peoples. The new peace structure in the Middle East, including the secure and recognized boundaries, must be built by Arab and Israeli hands"" [1686th meeting, para. 111].
Thus if Egypt will present its position for negotiation without the unprecedented request for Israel's acceptance of it in advance, we shall be ready for detailed and concrete negotiation on all the matters mentioned in the Egyptian memorandum of 15 February and the Israeli document of 26 February,
98.	Effective and versatile conciliation must include a capacity to move from one direction to another in a tireless pursuit of peace. In March 1968, Ambassador Jarring suggested a formula for the convening of meetings between the parties in Nicosia on the basis of an agreed term of reference. Egypt rejected that proposal. Those concerned with the conciliation effort did not say that the mission had to be held in suspense until Egypt gave a positive reply to something which its policy did not then allow it to endorse. It would be wrong now to affirm that such a vital objective as the establishment of a negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt will never be possible except on the basis of a working paper which did not happen to secure the agreement of the parties. Egyptian-Israeli peace is too great a cause to be tied and tethered for all time to a single optional memorandum. If Egypt will agree to pursue negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior conditions on all the points listed in the Israeli and Egyptian memoranda of February 1971, this road to meaningful negotiation will lie open,
99.	There are other roads to peace. The Suez Canal agreement and the discussion of an over-all settlement are not the only options available for negotiation. The problem of refugees requires a broad acceptance of regional and international responsibility. We have therefore proposed the convening of a conference of Middle Eastern States, together with Governments which have contributed to refugee relief and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in order to chart a five-year plan for the solution of the refugee problem and the integration of refugees into productive life.
100.	This problem would now be considered against the background of some alleviating developments in recent months. There is a growing disillusion with the irredentist pretensions of the terrorist groups and the air pirates. The dividing wall which once prevented all human contact between Israelis and Palestine Arabs is falling. It is true that this is due so far to Israeli initiative. Last year not a single Israeli set foot in any Arab land, but 110,000 Arabs from countries ""at war"" with Israel came into contact with Israel across the open Jordan bridges. An open frontier between Israel and its eastern neighbor similar to the community frontiers in Europe would do much to give human reality to a peace settlement, and indeed might help the settlement to be achieved.
101.	There is a fourth possibility. The problems of boundaries and security are usually considered to be the crux of the negotiation. But there are other unresolved matters in the memoranda presented by Egypt and Israel in February. At first sight there seems to be some proximity between the peace, non-aggression, recognition and navigation clauses suggested by the two Governments. On closer inspection the disparities are substantial, and could become crucial. We suggested in January and later in March that, it might be profitable to attempt to draft some of the clauses of the Egyptian-Israel treaty relating to the principles of peace. It is an accepted negotiating technique to begin with problems in which divergences are less broad and thus to create a favorable atmosphere in which to confront the more acute problems.
102.	There is a fifth road towards negotiating procedure and activity; it concerns the negotiating procedure, but its weight is intensively substantive and not at all procedural I have said that in the early months of 1968 Ambassador Jarring suggested meetings between the parties, under his auspices, in Nicosia, in accordance with a text setting out the terms of reference for the conferences. On 10 March 1968, Ambassador Jarring informed me that Egypt had rejected that proposal. As the Secretary-General's report of 4 January 1971 reveals, Dr. Jarring ""was informed of Israel's official acceptance, without conditions, of the text"". 
103.	Now that was the negative turning-point in the history of the Jarring mission. Since then it has been limited, through Egyptian insistence, to a bizarre procedure under which Israeli documents are presented to Ambassador Jarring, and by him to the Egyptian representative. If the Israel document contains the words ""for communication to the Government of Egypt"", the Egyptian representative refuses to take it into his h?nds; or if he has inadvertently accepted its delivery, he comes back to relinquish it with panic-stricken haste as if it were a hot coal. The Israel document is then divulged by the Egyptian representative to the press, accompanied by a burst of invective. Egyptian replies are published without any hint of an intention to communicate them to Israel. The Egyptian position is that Israel may not talk to Egypt directly, may not talk to Egypt indirectly and may not communicate anything to Egypt in writing.
104.	If no other method is available my Government will communicate its views to Egypt by whatever channel or technique is possible. But we cannot conceal our conviction that there is an element of farce in the idea that the word ""negotiation"" can honestly be applied to the extraordinary procedure followed so far. How can a Government which alleges that it wants a peace agreement with Israel refuse to negotiate the terms of that agreement by a rational method of contact? To say that one is prepared to enter into a peace agreement but not to meet or negotiate even under international chairmanship is to make a mockery of the international community. One thing is clear: No international agreement has been reached on any subject between any States at any time by the methods to which the Jarring mission has so far been confined through Egypt's insistence.
105.	I am convinced that the strongest chance of breaking out of the deadlock lies in a transition to a rational negotiating procedure. The hour is ripe. The gap between the parties is wide, but may not be impossible to bridge. Negotiation is the agent which would transform the potentiality into action.
106.	One of the most important things said about the Middle East in recent days is Sir Alec Douglas-Home's statement yesterday that ""distrust... of this depth ... cannot [easily] be removed by long-distance correspondence"" [1944th meeting, para. 98] and that ""those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog'' [ibid., para, 97], If all those who hold that view would express it with equal candor, an international movement in favor of abandoning the illusion of long- range correspondence would come to effective expression.
107.	There is no weight or value in. the argument that the Arab Governments would be negotiating from weakness if they accepted direct contact under international chairmanship. Their point of reference would be, not the military situation, but the political forum in which the Arab side would speak from a position of numerical and geographical predominance,
108.	I therefore propose to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Riad, that we take our guidance from the spirit which inspires the international life of our ags. Let us meet here this month under the auspices of the United States to discuss the details and! principles of a Suez Canal settlement; or under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jarring to discuss the establishment of peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of our respective memoranda of February 1971. Let us break out of devious procedures and sterile polemics into a new vision and a new hope.
109.	In a recent statement the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, declared that he would sacrifice a million men to achieve a military victory. What he and we should be considering is how to ensure that the 33 million Egyptians, tin 3 million Israelis and the other millions in the Middle East are saved i.om sacrifice and preserved for the construction of a peaceful regional order. The task will not be served by war or by threats of renewed hostilities which command our vigilance but which are, in effect, an echo of ill-fated bombast in the recent past. Nor will our task be fulfilled by living out the rest of 1971 in ineffective debate or inflammatory resolutions. The Arab States may have enough voting strength to secure the adoption of virulent, unbalanced texts or to give a biased interpretation to the Security Council resolution, which would then cease to be an agreed documentary consensus available as a basis for the ultimate and inevitable negotiation. But what will it profit to gain an Assembly majority, but to lose Israel's adherence to a set of principles common to it and to neighboring States? The roads to peace do not have their starting point in war or in polemical debate. They branch out from one of the many avenues and by-ways of negotiation on which we shall meet Egypt when its choice is made and declared.
110.	This session could mark a recuperation in the career of ""the United Nations if the Organization made this the year of negotiation, the year of negotiation in all outstanding disputes. It has other tasks. The Second United Nations Development Decade can be saved from the frustrations of the First if the advanced countries turn aside from the perils of monetary war towards an expanding vocation in the development of emergent societies.
111.	And in the last resort this Organization will be judged according to the role it has played in defense of human welfare and dignity, The call of kinship and of dark memory will bring us to refer at appropriate stages in Committees and in the plenary meetings to two dramas of great intensity and pathos: the Jews of the Soviet Union, of whom some have reached us but of whom the great majority are still restrained from the expression of their cultural identity and their national hope; and the captive remnants of helpless Jews in Arab lands, especially in Syria, whose anguished voice cries out for liberation from terror and despair. This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit. It may be bearing within itself the seed of a universal order in which men will come together to save their environment from pollution, their society from disruption, their economy from decline, their life from the stress and grip of violence. There is no room for fatalistic despair. There is still time for men and nations to be, inspired by a new and spacious vision and to invest their thought and labour in defence of the ""common heritage of mankind"".



"
5,1999,"ISR_post_1998","The fifty-fourth session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations takes place
at a time marking humanity's crossing into the next
millennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain of
tumultuous events that have reshaped the map of the
family of nations.
12


The United Nations was born against the backdrop of
the destruction and desolation of the Second World War,
the most bitter, deadly and inhumane war known to
mankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths of
evil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization and
will be recalled in history as a nightmare in which man
created the devil, who wreaked devastation, destruction,
terror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken by
the Allied forces against the Nazi monster, and the creation
of the United Nations in April 1945, on the verge of the
defeat of the forces of destruction, was an act that marked
the return of humanity to its senses, to salvage the future of
mankind.
In this month when we mark 60 years since the
outbreak of the most horrible of wars, we are strengthened
more than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in the
necessity of the United Nations and of its activities
throughout the world. The various agencies of the United
Nations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; to
supply the needy with food and nourishment; to build
bridges between cultures; to promote education and
overcome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugees
and displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters,
whether natural or man-made.
The soldiers of the United Nations forces are the true
peacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from all
the nations of the world. At times they risk their lives in
areas riddled with conflict and violence around the world,
whether their United Nations mandate is to make peace or
to be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions,
important as they may be to the policy makers and shapers
of international relations, have no meaning to the individual
United Nations soldier, posted far from his country, who
brings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy,
suffering and violence.
After many centuries of violence and war, of
enslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderous
ideologies, after decades of cold war and polarized world
alliances of the East and the West, the human race is now
making great strides down the paths of peace and
reconciliation. Before our very eyes, a process is
enveloping the world, signalling hope for the future.
Mankind is adopting a new path, the path of the prophet
Isaiah, who as far back as 2,600 years ago prophesied that
the day would come when
“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)
This prophecy — which has been adopted by the
United Nations as a source of hope, as the symbol of the
victory of the good in human beings over evil — should
serve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for all
who cherish peace around the world and for their
representatives gathered here today.
The world has become more open. Satellites, the
Internet and telecommunications networks shorten
geographical and cultural distances. The political and
ideological blocs of the past have disintegrated, and the
walls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants and
dictators who built them. They are being replaced by new
blocs, some of which are in the process of being created
where development and prosperity reign. I hope and
believe that these beneficial transformations will also
occur in the Middle East.
In our region, too, the light of hope has been
rekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process,
the objective of which is to reach peace between States
and reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reach
a comprehensive peace with its neighbours, a peace of
harmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merely
political or strategic peace. In our eyes, the absence of
war is not the peace we aspire to achieve.
May I be allowed to emphasize once again that
peace means a culture of peace; peace means no more
threats of violence, whether implied or categorical; peace
entails the end of boycotts, the end of contempt and
defamation, the end of incitement and confrontation...
peace is also a language of peace: it is the way leaders
address their nations, teachers teach their students and
religious leaders inspire their followers.
At a time when various kinds of religious extremism
are rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom and
human freedom, it is essential that inter-faith dialogue be
strengthened and that the religions be manifested in their
enlightened forms, which sanctify tolerance and
coexistence.
On the way to achieving peace in our region, we
often find ourselves confronted with contradictory
realities. Parallel to the political process, our negotiating
partners are conducting a constant political war against
Israel in various international forums, including from the
podium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent
13


with the peace process and is intolerable, as are the extreme
decisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. These
decisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace, as
expressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
We hoped for and expected a different atmosphere,
one that would complement the impetus initiated by the
new Government in Israel. We have been saddened to
witness events that undermine the essence of peace. These
events can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.
Engaging in a peace process, on the one hand, and
maintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions, on the
other, raises some serious concerns about our negotiating
partners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace of
normalization with open borders, or is it only one of
temporary initial recognition? Will our relations with the
Gulf and Maghreb countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia,
Mauritania, Qatar and Oman, be allowed to expand and
develop? Or will these relations remain hostage to mood
swings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations or
whenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts about
these cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light of
the heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking upon
itself in this process.
Three weeks ago, on 4 September, Israel and the
Palestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum, which for the first time creates a direct,
chronological, political and conceptual link between the
Interim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13
September, the final status talks were renewed between
Israelis and Palestinians.
We are determined to reach a framework agreement
that will form the basis of the final status agreement by
February 2000, as stated and agreed upon in the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will select
the issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.
The topics at hand are known, as are the differing vantage
points and positions of each side. The differences can be
resolved only by direct negotiations.
Regarding the final status, I wish to affirm from this
podium that when we refer to political separation as one of
the prime concepts of the permanent settlement, we are also
saying that, for the benefit of both sides, we should not
necessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in the
various spheres of living.
From Israel’s perspective, there is no competition and
never has been any between the different negotiating tracks.
Israel also aspires to reach peace with Syria, our
neighbour to the north. This is, after all, in the higher
common interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r ,
along with these common interests, the following point
must be made clear: A democratic country like Israel
cannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks that
requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as
dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the
opposing side.
We must maintain the momentum of good will so
that we can face our children, Syrian and Israeli alike,
with a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:
We tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon the
leaders of Syria, in view of what we have gone through
together, to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetings
and discussion are not political sacrifices — they are
basic necessities.
On the road to a comprehensive peace, we wish to
see Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomaly
which has developed in its territory must come to an end.
We have never had nor do we have now any territorial
claims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and only
interest is to guarantee the safety and security of our
citizens. I must say that, regrettably, the Government of
Lebanon has for many years failed to enforce its
sovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarm
Hezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and that
Israel, within the framework of an agreement, will be able
to leave the southern part of Lebanon.
Nevertheless, with that as our ambition, I wish to
emphasize that we will not be held hostage much longer
on this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We will
make our own independent decisions, as we see fit, in
order to ensure our protection and our vital interests,
taking all options under consideration.
A reconciliation between Israel and its neighbours
must extend the promise that all the peoples of the region
may reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must not
be viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcome
of peaceful coexistence, normalization is not in the
service of one particular party. It is in the interests of all
the nations of the region.
We hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early as
this year. There is a need for close cooperation in
regional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendous
potential. In order to fully realize this potential, we must
establish a mechanism of true cooperation among the
14


States of the region. This cooperation would clearly be to
the benefit of all of us in the region.
The scarcity of water in our region, which will only
get worse, may impose a new way of life on the inhabitants
of the Middle East in the coming years. Israel is
anticipating this problem and preparing for it, but in this
case, as in others, cooperation in the region is essential and
will benefit all sides.
The working groups of the multilateral tracks
undertook various assignments of primary importance.
Unfortunately, their activities have been frozen for
irrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Any
delay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peace
process and delay the aid packages so essential to the
peoples of the region. Throughout this important process,
on the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike, we are
accompanied by the international community. First and
foremost was the United States of America, along with the
Russian Federation, the European Union, Canada, Norway,
Japan, China and other countries and organizations that
have assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributions
earn them special commendation from this rostrum.
Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking
down the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in our
region. Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as
renewing the multilateral tracks, are essential to furthering
the common objectives of the nations in our region. T h e
relations between Israel and Jordan are an example of
appropriate and favourable relations between neighbouring
countries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations
between the two nations in the economic, social and
political realms.
As we march further along the difficult path of
making peace, we look back with sorrow and sadness as we
remember the pioneers who broke new ground and are no
longer with us today: the late Menachem Begin, Anwar
Saddat, Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein and King Hassan II
of Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us to
continue to work towards completing their enterprise of
peacemaking.
We cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region is
neither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiate
the peace process, we remain aware of the threats and
dangers directed against us, threatening the stability of the
entire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism, on the
one hand, and of the potential use of weapons of mass
destruction, on the other, threatens the peace, stability and
future of the entire region. This threat is not just an
element of academic debates in the study of international
relations, but a harsh reality which we must all face.
From this international platform, I call for a halt to
all technological, scientific and other kinds of assistance
to countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons,
while threatening the existence of the State of Israel and
the region as a whole.
The Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadership
lacking reason and stability poses a threat to all the
countries in the region and to the world at large. The
monitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must be
immediately resumed. That is the obligation of the
international community so long as the Iraqi regime seeks
non-conventional weapons and threatens the region. The
United Nations is the largest, most authoritative and most
recognized international body. It should therefore be the
one to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbing
this danger.
Terrorism is an additional strategic enemy and we
cannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat not
only to Israel, but to many other nations across the world
as well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. There
can be no coexistence with terror, either in the context of
the negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours,
or in the broader regional context. Anyone who believes
that terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated is
mistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. A
synthesized, coordinated and unrelenting approach must
be adopted against it.
Here, in this building of stone and glass, reflecting
the current image of our world today with its points of
light and shadows of darkness, counterparts and enemies
meet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum for
discussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way to
resolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogue
and common language are the tools of diplomacy, the raw
material for the creation of a new reality and the
foundation for a stable and safer society.
It was here in the General Assembly, at the
beginning of the decade, that I first met with my Chinese
counterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation between
our two countries, we endeavoured to re-establish
diplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was also
here that we laid the groundwork for establishing ties
with the former Soviet Union, as well as with India,
Nigeria and other States. These are only a few examples
15


demonstrating the possibility in this arena for building a
bridge between nations and States.
As a nation that experienced great difficulties,
overcome only by accelerated development efforts, the State
of Israel takes part in the international effort to aid others
and share knowledge, experience and technology,
experience which it has accumulated in various fields. The
nation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharing
and identifying with the world at large.
Through the Division for International Cooperation
within the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel maintains ongoing
projects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. We
have demonstration units and we are conducting research.
For example, a special medical centre was recently
established in Mauritania and serves the many citizens of
that State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly,
Israel invests great efforts and resources in training
professionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary for
meeting the various challenges that engage many parts of
the world.
In the more than 40 years since its inception, the
Division for International Cooperation has trained more
than 70,000 trainees from more than 120 countries, who
have come to Israel and attended its training courses in the
areas of agriculture, water resources, health and medicine,
science, education and others.
In 1998 alone, some 155 courses were held in Israel
on a variety of topics, with the participation of more than
4,000 trainees. Gladly, I can report that many of the
trainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820
Palestinians participated in these courses over the past year,
thereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace which
have been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In the
same year, Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60
different countries, with the participation of over 7,000
trainees. I am proud to point out that in many of the
countries to which we sent Israeli experts, the local
personnel managed to translate our goodwill into positive
results on the ground, to the benefit of their people and
their land.
Because of the reputation it has acquired, the Division
for International Cooperation is also one of the central
addresses in Israel to which people can turn in times of
disaster around the world. We have recently witnessed just
how essential such assistance can be in times of natural
disasters. Israel has always responded favourably to
requests for aid and relief, regardless of the political
context or the state of diplomatic relations.
We wish to support and commend the United States
of America, our friend and ally, an inspiration to us all in
its efforts to promote the values of cooperation among
nations. This is also the time to express our appreciation
to the United States for its intensive efforts to bring true
peace to the Middle East.
Even today in the United States we have witnessed
again a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case at
hand is the threat to declare a boycott against the
American company Disney, because the company dared
to allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibition
celebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats and
the use by certain Arab States of this anachronistic
device. It has no place here or anywhere else in the
world.
Over thousands of years, since the time of biblical
King David, the builder of Jerusalem, until the present
day, Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any other
nation in the world besides the nation of Israel, the
Jewish people. Even after our forced exile from the land
of Israel, we continued, generation after generation, to
stay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem was
carried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.
In our wanderings, in the East and in the West, in
the African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia, from
the golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition,
during the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to the
charred ashes of the Holocaust, throughout all the above
the eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directed
toward Jerusalem. Year after year, from father to son, the
anthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been “Next
Year in Jerusalem”.
With the passing of those previous generations and
exiles, we have had the privilege of being deemed worthy
to return to Jerusalem, to rebuild the ruins, to rededicate
the city as a centre radiating with beauty, open to all
followers of all religions, as the poet has said, where
freedom of all religions is a fact of life.
It is so upsetting then that even today, 51 years since
the independence of the State of Israel, there are still
those who would deny our natural right to decide the
location of our capital, a natural right given to every
nation in the world. From Jerusalem, the city of David, I
will quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem,
16


in words which transcends the limits of time and retains
their meaning in every generation:
“Our feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmly
together.” (The Holy Bible, Psalm 122:2-3)
Today, as before, from this podium we declare to the
entire world, to our friends and people and those who are
distant from us: Jerusalem, unified under Israeli
sovereignty, is and will remain forever the capital of Israel.

"
5,1979,"ISR_prev_1998","161.	Mr, President, please accept my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide the work of the Assembly efficiently and fairly.
162.	I would also like to express our appreciation to the President of the last session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Lievano of Colombia.
163.	It is my pleasure to congratulate Saint Lucia on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
164.	As we reflect on the development of the United Nations throughout the past year, we find the spectacle far from encouraging. The fundamental obstacle to the Organization's work is the selectivity which has been forced upon it by an automatic majority of the membership, which is far from impartial and prefers expediency to principles. The United Nations specialized agencies have suffered badly from this. Organs like UNESCO, WHO, the ILO and others have been severely affected by heavy politicization which has influenced their functioning. Instead of dedicating themselves solely to their specific fields in the service of mankind, they have been reduced to forums of political one-sidedness.
165.	There must be a return to the United Nations Charter. Consultation and agreement should be restored to their primary place. In particular, the specialized agencies must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they have been dragged, so that they may devote themselves to the economic, social, humanitarian, scientific and technological tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform so well when permitted to do so.
166.	There has been little improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Even though the number of exit visas for Soviet Jews has increased recently, the gap between the number of Jews applying for exit visas and those granted them is growing, while an even larger number of Soviet Jews have been denied the fundamental right to emigrate—a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki Declaration. Those Jews who do insist on their rights are subjected to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment and, in some cases, to arrest and imprisonment. We have taken note of the fact that seven Jewish prisoners were released a few months ago. However, we are particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences imposed on other Jews whose only crime is their desire to re-join their families in Israel—Iosif Begun, Boris Kalendarov, Iosif Mendelevich, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Simon Shnirman, Vladimir Slepak, Aleksandr Vilic and Amner Zavurov. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and permit everyone who seeks to emigrate to Israel and join his people and his family to do so.
167.	We cannot be silent in the face of the rising incitement against the State of Israel and the Jewish people, its religion, culture and national movement, as manifested day by day in the official Soviet media. In this regard, it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their religion and culture. We appeal to the Soviet Union to allow Jewish religion and culture to be practised and expressed freely, and to put an end to anti-Jewish propaganda.
168.	We also deeply regret that the Government of Syria continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and to be reunited with their relatives living in other lands. We appeal to the Syrian Government to change this policy.
169.	The past year witnessed a historic break-through in the Middle East. In March, Israel and Egypt signed the first ever Israel-Arab peace treaty. President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel concluded that Treaty after intense negotiations, which lasted a year and a half and which demanded great leadership and courage. Israel wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States of America and to its President, Mr. Jimmy Carter, personally for the vital role which they played in bringing about this historic achievement, which has created a new reality in our region.
170.	Let me recall here that Israel has throughout the first 30 years of its independence constantly extended its hand to its neighbours in the search for peace. This found expression on the very first day of the establishment of our State, in the Israel Declaration of Independence of 14 May 1948. Let me add specifically that as early as in the summer of 1967, very shortly after the six-day war, Israel had taken the initiative and offered to sign a treaty of peace with Egypt, declaring its readiness to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egyptian sovereignty in the context of a peace treaty. This Israeli proposal was rejected, and the answer given by Egypt at the time was: ""No negotiation, no recognition and no peace with Israel: what was taken by force will be taken back by force."" This year, however, has seen the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. After a generation of continued warfare, the realization of a dream begins.
171.	The Treaty of Peace, which, as stated in its preamble, is ""an important step in the search for comprehensive peace in the area,"" has provided for a role in its implementation to be fulfilled by the United Nations. United Nations forces and observers were called upon to carry out functions in order to see that the peace treaty was fully implemented. Ironically and paradoxically, that initiative taken by some States Members of the United Nations in the cause of peace was rejected by the United Nations. The Security Council was exposed to the threat of a Soviet veto, and the mandate of UNEF was not renewed, so that the Security Council in effect disassociated itself from the first positive and major step in the great effort to relieve the Middle East from the dangers of war.
172.	Although our assumption and hope that the United Nations would assist in the implementation of the Treaty of Peace have been disappointed, we will proceed along the path of peace. The attitude of the United Nations will not damage the peace process; but it will, no doubt, lower the prestige and even the moral stature of the United Nations, one of whose basic principles and purposes is, as stated by the Charter, to ""maintain international peace and security . . . and to bring about by peaceful means . . . settlement of international disputes. . . ''.
173.	As a result of the Treaty of Peace, the process of normalization in the relations between Egypt and Israel has already begun. We are confident that in the months ahead we shall make further progress in cementing new bonds of co-operation.
174.	The frequent visits and meetings of the leaders of both countries are also an expression of the common desire to promote understanding and closer personal relationships. The most recent—and most impressive—visit of President El-Sadat to Israel three weeks ago and the reception given him in the city of Haifa, where Jews and Arabs coexist in harmony and cooperation, indicated the deep feelings of all the population of Israel towards the era of peace and, we hope, left warm memories in the minds and hearts of our Egyptian guests.
175.	Over the past year the situation in Lebanon has become grave. The intervention of Syria has, in fact, plunged the northern part of that formerly prosperous country into a state of anarchy, and the Lebanese Government has become incapable of ruling and exercising its authority over all of its territory. The southern part of Lebanon has been, to a great extent, in the hands of the terrorist groups of the PLO, whose murderous activities have been a source of danger and harassment not only to Israel, but also to the Christian and Moslem Lebanese in that area.
176.	UNIFIL was established by Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978.
177.	Israel, having been compelled to act militarily against the PLO in southern Lebanon in a clear act of self-defence, agreed to withdraw its forces, provided that the new United Nations force would undertake to restore peace and security in the area and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the country.
178.	Unfortunately, the aim of restoring Lebanon's integrity has not been achieved, and the Lebanese Government is still incapable of exercising its sovereignty. PLO terrorist groups are still functioning all over Lebanon and, in quite a large number of cases, inside the area of United Nations units. In this region, which was free from any terrorist presence at the time of the Israeli withdrawal, there are now about 700 PLO terrorists, who are acting murderously through the lines of the United Nations Force against the people of Israel. The Force was supposed to act against this. The Secretary-General, in his initial report of 19 March 1978 spoke of the right of self-defence of the Force, including resistance by forceful means to attempts to prevent it from discharging its duties.
179.	In his report of 13 September 1978, the Secretary-General stated, among the guidelines and terms of reference of UNIFIL, that ""uniformed or armed personnel and military equipment are not allowed to enter the UNIFIL area of operation""."" However, there are too many cases in which the Force has in fact reconciled itself to the presence and activities of the terrorists in its own area. UNIFIL has not carried out its mandate and duties in this respect, despite the fact that its units have themselves suffered from terrorist activities and at least eight UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in these incidents. The presence and activities of the PLO terrorist groups in the region are in violation of the UNIFIL mandate, and it should be understood that Israel cannot be expected to sit back while terror is being unleashed against its population, no matter where in Lebanon these actions originate.
180- Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries ceased to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. No cause can justify terrorism. The issue is, therefore, a fundamental one for the international community, and the struggle against terrorism should continue until terrorism has been brought to an end.
181.	The PLO, by its very nature and actions, is a terrorist organization. Its true character is reflected in its so-called' 'Covenant"", which calls for the purging of the Zionist presence from Palestine. The same document denies the existence of the Jewish people and its unbroken historical ties with the land of Israel. It alleges that the establishment of the State of Israel is null and void and rejects outright any plans to settle the Middle East conflict by peaceful means.
182.	The PLO has not hesitated to try to translate its vicious doctrine into criminal deeds. It has conducted an unceasing campaign of terror aimed at the mass murder of innocent civilians in Israel. From June 1967 to date, over 640 people have been murdered and 3,300 others have been wounded in Israel by the PLO. It has also terrorized and intimidated Arabs prepared to negotiate peace with Israel, killing more than 350 Arabs and injuring almost 2,000 others.
183.	Given the PLO's character and aims, it was, in fact, recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process. No country can or should be expected to negotiate with a party which denies its very existence, aims at its destruction, and uses terror against its civilian population. On the other hand, careful provision was made in the Camp David agreements to include Palestinian Arab residents of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District in the peace process.
184.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East, Agreed at Camp David by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel, and witnessed by the President of the United States of America, refers positively and constructively to Palestinian Arab rights, as well as to the rights and security interests of the other parties. It is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which are the only agreed basis for peace negotiations in the Middle East. Any tampering with them can only gravely jeopardize the current peace process.
185.	This Framework agreement sees the solution of the question of the Palestinian Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District in terms of granting them full autonomy, for a transitional period of five years, before reaching an agreement on the final status of the area. For that reason, it was agreed to negotiate on a principle of self-government—exercised through an administrative council—for the Arab inhabitants of the areas in question.
186.	Moreover, in the preamble to this Framework, the signatories invited other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere to it as well. In the letter sent by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel to President Carter on 26 March 1979—the date of the signing of the peace treaty—they invited the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Join the negotiations.
187.	This Framework provides for negotiations on the transitional period of five years, and also for the subsequent negotiations on a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, in which the location of the boundaries dividing the two countries will be agreed. The option of creating a third State between Israel and Jordan is, therefore, not considered in the Camp David agreements.
188.	Thus, the objective of the negotiations being held now, based on the Camp David Framework, is the provision of full autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. The Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants. This Framework also specifies measures that will be taken to assure the security of Israel and its neighbours.
189.	The only way to keep the process of peace going on is for us to adhere strictly to the Camp David agreements in their letter and spirit, and I should like to assure this Assembly that this is the policy of Israel.
190.	Before concluding, let me say a few words about Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people.
191.	Jerusalem has known many foreign rulers during the course of its long history, but none of them regarded it as their capital. Only the Jewish people has always maintained it as the sole centre of its national and spiritual life. For thousands of years, Jews have prayed daily for their return to Jerusalem and, for the past century and a half, Jerusalem has had a continuous and uninterrupted Jewish majority.
192.	Jerusalem cannot be divided again by barbed wire and there can be no return to the repeated shooting at our civilians and the barbaric desecration of the Jewish quarter of the City, the Holy Places and cemeteries, as happened before 1967, when the eastern part of Jerusalem was under the occupation of Jordan. It is relevant to recall that, in grave violation of the 1949 Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement; Jordan prevented Jews from having access to their Holy Places and cultural institutions and tried to eliminate systematically every trace of Jerusalem's Jewish past. By contrast, as a result of Israel's policy of free access to all Holy Places, millions of Moslem and Christian tourists and pilgrims—in addition to Jewish visitors—have come to Jerusalem since 1967, and have prayed and worshipped freely at its mosques and churches.
193.	Jerusalem is now a city of coexistence between Jews and Arabs. At the same time, the Government of Israel is and has always been conscious of the fact that Jerusalem is of deep concern also to other faiths, and that its religious and cultural sites are precious to Christians and Moslems, as well as to Jews. There should be completely free access to all the holy shrines by believers of all religions, without any exception, completely protected and guaranteed by the law of the country, and those holy shrines should be administered by the respective representatives of the religions concerned, without any interference.
194.	The choice before the United Nations is clear. This Organization, whose Charter enjoins it to support the cause of international peace and security, must not submit to the designs of those who reject peace. Let the United Nations give peace its full support. Let the Governments of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judaea, Samaria and Gaza join the negotiations in order to achieve the noble goal of a real and durable comprehensive peace in our area."
5,1980,"ISR_prev_1998","Mr. President, at the outset I should like to express to you our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and the outstanding qualities that you have exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy ensure your ability to keep a firm grasp on the helm of the Assembly during this stormy period.
53.	Al the opening of this session a new State joined the ranks of the United Nations: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I should like to welcome it to the Organization and wish it all prosperity and success as an independent and sovereign Stale.
54,	To my very grout regret, it is not possible to express satisfaction at the condition of the United Nations today, cither in general or from the specific perspective of my country. Indeed, it is questionable whether there remains much similarity or correlation between the noble ideals, principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the United Nations and the reality prevailing in the Organization today. The founders of this Organization saw in their vision a forum and a framework for the achievement and maintenance of peace between nations after the horrific experience of the Second World War, a horror which they had experienced at first hand.
55.	Perhaps the most cynical expression of the gap between the original vision and the reality prevailing in the United Nations today has been the refusal of this Organization, ostensibly dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to adopt and encourage the Camp David accords' and the subsequent Peace Treaty, which brought to an end decades of hostilities between Israel and Egypt and raised the possibility of expanding the peace process to embrace all of Israel's neighbours. This Organization, whose principal purpose is the promotion of peace among nations, has thus betrayed its own raison d'etre by rejecting an historic step towards peace and by playing into the hands of the enemies of peace, the rejectionists and the warmongers.
56. This unhappy phenomenon is not confined to the General Assembly. Out of the 18 debates which have been conducted thus far during 1980 in the Security Council, nine were devoted to subjects involving my country. Is there anyone who seriously believes that half of the world's international problems today are connected with Israel? We need only glance at a map of our region, the Middle East—which is just one region of the world—to sec that it is riddled from length to breadth with countless conflicts between States, between ethnic minorities and between different religious groups. Virtually all those conflicts have a history and a dynamic of their own, totally divorced from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
57. By way of illustration. I need only mention the situation in Afghanistan and. of course, the full-scale war between Iran and Iraq—a worrying outbreak of hostilities which has wide-ranging implications. That war between two States ruled by extremist, irresponsible and trigger-happy regimes threatens both regional and international security by putting at risk much of the world's regular supply of oil, That war, a struggle between two Moslem States, demolishes, in our opinion, the naive and groundless belief that the world's oil supply is dependent on a pro-Arab solution to the dispute between Israel and its neighbours. It has become all too clear that the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will not provide any miracle cure for the region as a whole or eliminate the many other grave conflicts raging in it. The ability of the United Nations to work for an end to the bloodshed in Iraq and Iran will be a yardstick of the Organization's ability to continue to fulfil its role for the encouragement and maintenance of peace.
58.	Important tasks have been allotted to the United Nations. Besides its role in the preservation of international peace and security, it also has a vital role to play in other spheres which require our earnest attention, in particular through the specialized agencies established for various purposes. But even the specialized agencies have been gravely compromised by the plague of politicization. Business-like debates and deliberations in them have become increasingly difficult—if not all but impossible to conduct—to the grave detriment not only of the agencies themselves but also of those whom they were set up to serve.
59.	While I am bound to express deep regret at the condition of the United Nations today. I must also express the hope that all Members of the Organization which share our concern and feelings of responsibility for its future will intensify their efforts both to bring the United Nations back to the ideals of its founders and to channel the specialized agencies back to their specific areas of concern.
60.	Among the subjects which have rightly been given a prominent place in the agenda of the United Nations are the state of the world's economy and the relations between the industrialized and the developing nations. The convening of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly attests to this fact. Israel took part in that special session with the intention of making a constructive contribution to its work. We therefore share the disappointment over the results of that event, which were not adequate. We sincerely hope that in the near future the efforts to have a constructive dialogue rather than confrontation will be resumed, so that those whose needs are greatest will not suffer the most.
61.	Despite our small size and limited resources, we have for decades devoted far greater efforts than might have been expected to assisting nations of the third world in the development of their economies and societies. Israel has shared freely the know-how which it has developed, as well as its experience as a small State in an arid and subtropical region, which has enabled us to make great strides over a period of a few short years.
62.	The problems encountered by Israel in the course of its social and economic development are similar to the problems facing much of the developing world today. Many of the solutions worked out in Israel can be applied directly by others. Despite the disappointments which my country has experienced, Israel continues to have deep sympathy for the struggle of the developing countries to ameliorate and advance the condition of their peoples and economies. Israel stands ready to continue to give of its know-how and to take a vigorous and constructive part in the efforts of the international community in the spheres of health, social services, agriculture, development of new and renewable sources of energy, and in every other sphere to which we can contribute.
63.	From this rostrum I should like to give expression to the anguish of our Jewish brothers in various parts of the globe. There is. it would seem, no end to the pain of the Jew in history. The suffering and persecution continue even today. And we, the people of Israel, feel responsible for the lot of every Jew who suffers anywhere.
64.	In the last year additional harsh limitations have been imposed on Jews who seek to leave the Soviet Union and emigrate to the State of Israel. Those restrictions conflict with the most basic human and national rights of peoples, and we are in duty bound to echo the cries of the Jews in the Soviet Union and appeal to the Government of that country to remove the restrictions and facilitate the immigration of Jews to Israel.
65.	We must also express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed, and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic-human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds as hostages and which it prevents from leaving.
66.	The Jews of Iran have suffered painfully in recent months, and their situation is deteriorating from day to day. Many Jews have been thrown in gaol; others have been given the death sentence, in most cases on ""charges"" of contact with Israel. We know of the difficulties in dealing with the present regime in Iran, to which fundamental concepts of human rights and the norms of international relations seem foreign. But we hope that sight will not be lost of the situation of the Jews there who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of the minorities in that troubled land.
67.	Two years ago a development took place in the Middle East—a breakthrough which can appropriately be called historic. After serious negotiations between the parties, with the active and important participation of the United States, the Camp David framework and the subsequent Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty were signed by the leaders of the two countries and witnessed by the President of the United States. Israel made major concessions and took considerable risks by signing those agreements, l.et me cite only our withdrawal from the oilfields in Sinai, for there is no need for me to waste words on the significance and implications of that step in this day and age. Similarly I need only point to the strategic depth in Sinai which Israel has relinquished, as well as to the advanced air bases located in Sinai, the evacuation of which will be implemented in due course in accordance with the terms of the Peace Treaty.
68.	Israel believed that its concessions and sacrifices would be met with appreciation and understanding by the world community and that a long-awaited breakthrough would be achieved on the international scene. Not only has that not 06itte about, but many countries in the world have spared no effort to destroy that hard-won peace, and Israel continues to be the object of unending accusations and attacks.
69.	Nevertheless, the decision and determination of Israel remain firm to continue on the road to peace. Thus, in accordance with the Camp David framework, negotiations have taken place for the attainment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea. Samaria and the Gaza District.
70.	Substantial progress has been achieved in these talks in certain fields, but the talks have, it is true, had their tips and downs and have even been suspended a number of times by Egypt. There is nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the difficulties encountered thus far in the progress of the talks. They reflect the complexities inherent in the subjects under discussion. The difficulties are familiar to any country which, at one time or another, has been engaged in complex negotiations involving multifaceted and long-standing problems.
71.	One area in which progress has been achieved in the negotiations is the modalities of the free elections to be held in the territories concerned. These procedures would make the proposed autonomy into one of the few—all too few— examples of free democratic process in the Middle East. Progress has also been achieved in the area of powers and responsibilities of the autonomy covering many aspects of the everyday life of the inhabitants of the territories in question.
72.	We certainly believe that autonomy can and must be established. All the parties to the Camp David framework are convinced that the process set out in that framework is the only one which is within the realm of the possible. All alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem at hand—ideas such as the holding of an international conference or the like—are devoid of real prospect or purpose. No one can really believe that the various elements in the Middle East which arc so much at odds with each other would attend a peace conference and achieve a positive outcome that would lead to a solution acceptable to all. Thus too the ideas entertained by the European Community, which do not take Israel's position into account, are only likely to encourage those who are opposed to peace.
73.	Those who genuinely seek peace should encourage the progress which has been achieved through the Camp David process. Let them also bear in mind and give due regard to the fact that, by proposing the idea of autonomy in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, Israel has taken on itself great risks for the sake of peace.
74.	We hope that the autonomy talks will be resumed in the near future. We also hope that the process of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt will be intensified and will serve as the best possible proof and a living symbol of the fact that peace can and must take the place of war. The full significance of these peaceful relations should be grasped for what they are—and for what they may lead to—as the very corner-stone for peace in the region.
75. The leaders of Israel and Egypt have reiterated time and again their mutual commitment to the proposition that there will be no more war. Let us hope that the change which has come about in the Middle East with the signing of peace will be the opening for a positive and long-lasting transformation in the history of our conflict-ridden area. The strict adherence to the agreements by Israel, in accordance with their letter and spirit alike, is a guarantee of the continuation of the peace process. However, by itself it is not enough. We hope that all the others involved will act in the same way.
76. Much has been alleged against Israel in the name of the principle of self-determination for nations. We favour that concept, and we have proved that in the support that we extended to many States which have achieved their independence in our generation, in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. The Governments of those States and their peoples know that full well. But there is no connection between that principle and the perverted attempt to turn self-determination into the basis for the destruction of the Stale of Israel, as certain States are endeavouring to do. Anyone who is familiar with the ideology and the terminology of the murder organization that calls itself the PLO, as well as with the declarations of the various Arab rejectionist States, can see beyond all doubt that the term ""self-determination"", as they use it, is nothing more than a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.
77.	It should not be forgotten that the Palestinian Arabs have achieved their self-determination in Jordan, a State which is the Arab State in Palestine, by virtue of its history, territory, population, culture and all aspects of its national life. The establishment of a second Palestinian Arab Slate by distorting the principle of self-determination means the creation of an extremist and hostile base opposed to the very-existence of Israel. Hence we will not agree to a distorted form of self-determination, which in reality implies self-destruction for our ancient nation deeply rooted in its own land.
78.	The programme of autonomy which we have proposed for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, as accepted in principle in the Camp David frameworks, is the first practical proposal to be advanced to provide a dignified solution for the needs of the Arab population of those areas. It comes in place of all the empty declarations with which the Palestinian Arabs concerned have deluded themselves and have been deluded by other States and organizations over the years.
79.	One of the most vivid expressions of the rejection of all peace proposals by the Arab rejectionist States is to be seen in their unprecedented military build-up and in the armaments which they have received in recent years from the Soviet bloc or purchased from the United States and Western Europe. In the course of the last three years, orders for arms purchases by the larger Arab States have reached astronomic sums. The quantities of arms that were actually supplied have been equally staggering. There is no precedent for the amassing of arms on this scale in our region. Those arms are designated first and foremost for use against Israel. But the implications of that vast array of armaments ait not confined to my country alone. It also serves to inject war into the area at large.
80.	We call upon the United Nations to take due note of the military build-up by the Arab rejectionist States and to urge them to decrease their armament. For our part, we are prepared to lend a hand in any joint effort to bring about the limitation of arms in our region which is poised on top of a volcano.
81. I should like to address myself to another crucial aspect of disarmament. Israel has consistently supported resolutions of the General Assembly aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This global problem, we believe, can best be solved by means of negotiated regional arrangements. Hence, since 1975, Israel has consistently advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East on the Tlatelolco model. Israel believes that an international conference of all the Slates in the region and adjacent to our region should be held, leading to the conclusion of a formal, contractual, multilateral convention among all States of the region.
82.	We hope that in the course of this General Assembly, we shall find a suitable opportunity to give concrete expression to our views on this matter. In the meantime, I should like to reiterate my Government's position, which is that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israeli dispute.
83.	In the last months, Jerusalem has been the object of attacks on Israel in various international forums. There has been much hypocrisy and cynicism in those attacks, For, truth to tell, never has the situation of the various religions represented in Jerusalem been better than that prevailing since the unification of the city by Israel in 1967. For 19 years, between 1948 and 1967, the eastern part of the city was under Jordanian occupation and barbed wire divided it in two. Places holy to the Jews were maliciously desecrated. Ancient synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed in a barbaric manner, and Jews were denied access to the Holy Places which are the spiritual life-blood of the Jewish people. It is not out of place to remark that the Moslem Arab citizens of Israel were also denied access to their Holy Places during that ignoble period. And where, I am bound to ask, was the voice of this Organization during that period"".' Not once was it raised in condemnation of those illegal acts.
84.	On the other hand, since 1967. all—irrespective of religion and nationality—have been accorded free access to the city of Jerusalem and the possibility of worshipping at the Holy Places and shrines revered by them. Israel has assured the free and unfettered observance of the religious rites of all members of all faiths, who also administer their religious lives and their Holy Places without any outside interference. That is the truth well known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to everyone who has visited the city. There is no substance or basis to any claim to the contrary.
85.	There is no need for me to dwell at length on the bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem. The Jewish people is the only people which has made Jerusalem its capital since it appeared as a nation on the stage of human history. Throughout the many years of exile inflicted on it. The Jewish people prayed three times a day, every day, for its restoration to Jerusalem.
86. For the last 150 years there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Whoever seeks to sever Jerusalem from Israel seeks to decapitate the Jewish people. We hope that nations that seek peace and know the reality which prevails in Jerusalem today will respect the city as the sovereign capital of Israel; a city which will not be divided again, in the same way as Israel respects the Holy Places of all religions and their freedoms in the city.
87.	I wish to conclude with a call in the spirit of the Prophets of Israel, who were a light and an inspiration for much of mankind. My call is for peace—peace which is at the very basis of the existence of the United Nations.
88.	We in Israel yearn for peace. We have done so since the first day of the restoration of our national sovereignty—in our Declaration of Independence, which was issued on the very day that the State of Israel was founded in 1948. In that Declaration, we extend the hand of peace and good neighbourliness to all the States around us and all their peoples. We have taken far-reaching steps and have made huge sacrifices for the sake of peace. But peace with Israel does not mean peace without Israel, or peace at its expense. Nor does it mean peace with a weak Israel deprived of its capital and with its wings clipped from the security and geostrategic viewpoints. With such an Israel peace will not be attained, because a weak Israel will be an object of unceasing attacks and destructive designs.
89.	I wish to call upon the Arab States which are our neighbours, and also upon the Palestinian Arabs living in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, to follow the dictates of reason and to join the peace process. I wish to call upon the other nations of the world to support this course and to prevail upon the Arab States to adopt it. The world at large, and not merely our region alone, will benefit from this.
"
5,1986,"ISR_prev_1998","This session of the Assembly opens the fifth decade of the United Nations. I hope that it will begin an era in which this body will come closer to realizing the dreams of its founding fathers.
Their ideals were inspired and inspiring: safeguarding the principles of universality and equality, a genuine desire to maintain international peace and security, encouraging international cooperation in solving global problems and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Unfortunately, those lofty principles have been vitiated and perverted beyond recognition. Extremists have seized this body. They have compelled it to shun the only peace treaty in the Middle East - the Camp David Accords. They have forced upon it an annual ritual of adopting dozens of distorted and irrelevant resolutions relating to my country. In clinging to these barren exercises, the United Nations spends precious time and funds, resources that could profitably be used to combat
hunger and poverty.
These and other issues remain unresolved, however, and they demand serious and responsible attention. First among them is the repugnant reign of apartheid in South Africa.
Israel, founded upon basic moral and democratic values, cannot remain silent in the face of racial discrimination, wherever it nay occur.. We reject and condemn apartheid as a political, social and economic system. Israel also believes that violence is not the path to reform in South Africa. We must urgently foster a climate that will facilitate a political settlement if we are to avoid a further drift towards economic chaos, suffering and bloodshed. We hope responsible leaders on all sides will act to create such a climate and that the Government of South Africa will initiate negotiations that will satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of all South Africans, regardless of race or color.

In the heart of the African continent many continue to suffer from hunger, disease and poverty. There is a growing awareness around the world of the need to provide help. People must be fed right now. We have contributed to that effort, but we also believe that we must help countries afflicted by hunger to develop the long-term means to prevent its recurrence and to set their economies on the road to development and growth.
This past year the General Assembly convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The Organization of African unity (OAU) has outlined a development strategy that is reminiscent of Israel's own development experience. Israel announced at that special session its readiness to make immediate contributions to the attainment of those goals. We offered to share our experience in agriculture and desertification, in medicine and education and in the general field of economic development. Many in Africa remember our earlier contributions in this field. Our experience has been gained in 28 years of assistance by Israel to more than 100 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We have trained over 55,000 professionals from developing countries. We have shared our experience with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. And we are ready and willing to do more.
Many of those African States that severed relations with Israel in 1973 and 1974 are now in the process of resuming those relations. I wish to commend the leadership and courage of the Heads of State who have gone on to re-establish formal diplomatic ties with us despite the pressures exerted upon them. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all African nations and we expect many more countries to resume full diplomatic relations with Israel in the near future.
The Middle East, with its vast resources of land and minerals, has within it the potential to leap into a new age in the twenty-first century - an age of great economic prosperity and a better life for millions. But that hope hangs on the outcome of a precarious contest between those who seek progress and those who continually plunge the region into turmoil and hatred.
Perhaps the most tragic instance of the fanaticism that plagues our region is the cruel war waged by Iran and Iraq for the past six years. That war has claimed well over a million casualties; it has reintroduced outlawed means of warfare such as gas and chemical weapons and the wholesale torture of prisoners; it has hurt the entire world by threatening freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil. It is a sad commentary that, despite their various proclamations, those two warring Governments show no intention whatsoever of genuinely seeking ways to stop the horrible carnage.
Another instance of the reign of fanaticism and its terrible human cost is Lebanon. The tragedy is rooted in the chronic absence of an effective Government able to control and reconcile the warring factions. Without such a strong central authority, Lebanon has been unable to discharge the most elementary obligations of government - the control of one's territory against lawlessness and terror, terror directed against one's own citizens and against the citizens of neighboring States.
The first to pay for that anarchy have been the Lebanese themselves. Over 100,000 were slaughtered in the civil war of 1975-1976 and thousands of others have been killed since in sectarian clashes. Lebanon's Government has set no effective jurisdiction over any part of the country: not over the Bekaa Valley or Tripoli, where 20,000 Syrian troops physically occupy Lebanese territory; not over the Shouf Mountains; not even over Beirut itself. Such conditions encourage the reign of the gun, the rocket and the bomb throughout Lebanon. Naturally, the southern part of the country has not been exempt from that dismal pattern. Beginning with the PLO, various terrorist groups have used the south as a staging area for terrorist attacks against Israel. Those who expected that a ""Pax Syriana"" would pacify Lebanon were hopelessly deluded,.for Syrian domination of Lebanon has meant that Syria has been playing off one factor against another, as well as using Lebanon as a base for proxy terror attacks against Israel
and against targets world-wide.
That Syrian strategy, now shared by Iran, should concern the entire international community. As for Israel, we have one, and only one, objective regarding Lebanon: to protect northern Israel against attacks launched from Lebanon. This is self-defense in its simplest form. We shall not let Israeli citizens pay with their lives for Lebanon's failure to control its territory. We shall continue to take the necessary measures to defend our people. We hope that Lebanon will produce an effective Government with which we can agree on permanent security arrangements. In the meantime we shall continue to work with any Lebanese party genuinely interested in preventing terror in the South of Lebanon and in the North of Israel.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has tried to assist in bringing stability to the area. It has performed a useful role. It has suffered painful casualties in the process, including losses sustained in a recent rash of murderous attacks. We extend ou£r deepest condolences to the bereaved families end their Governments. We must be clear, however, on what role UNIFIL can and cannot play. International forces are most effective when they serve as buffers between two States that share a commitment to pacifying their common border. Unlike Israel's neighbors on two other borders, that is not the case with Lebanon. That is why UNIFIL, unlike the multinational Force in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, has been unable to act as an effective buffer, since the day it was established by the United Nations. Peace-keepers cannot be asked to combat terrorists. That role must be left to the Governments and the peoples in the area of turmoil. We shall continue to co-operate with UNIFIL, as we maintain the necessary security arrangements to defend our norther border.
Israel watches with concern the larger conflicts waged in our region: those between radicals and non-radicals, between conservative regimes and revolutionaries, among militant religious movements, and among the various dictatorships themselves. But there is little we can do to affect this tragic and chronic violence. Where we can act - where we have acted and shall continue to act - is in the limited confines of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.
Ever since Israel's independence we have made every effort to achieve peace with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our heritage. The Jewish people is a democratic and free people striving to rebuild its national life in the ancient - the only - homeland of the Jews. Israel is a haven for the persecuted, a land where ever Jew from whatever background feels at home. We can best achieve our ideals and goals in an atmosphere of peace and security. Hence, we cherish peace? we pray for it and we teach its blessings to our children. Our entire people rejoiced when, after decades of war which were forced upon us, we were able to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
During the past year we have made special efforts to broaden that peace. In July, Prime Minister Peres visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. We have made efforts to reinforce the peace treaty with Egypt and to solve the problems that are still outstanding. We hope we are on the threshold of a substantial improvement in the relations between our two countries. Such an improvement is vital in and of itself, and of even greater importance for the prospects for peace
with other Arab States.
A few days ago we marked the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. With the passage of time we can see that those accords were a turning-point in the history of the Middle East. They have proved decisively that there is a way out of the cycle of belligerency, and they have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no alternative to direct negotiations. To this very day they remain the one and only blueprint for accommodation and peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. All attempts to bypass, nullify or denigrate the Camp David accords have failed. Those attempts have been unsuccessful because they have disregarded the minimal needs of all parties, because they were not rooted in achievable proposals acceptable to all the sides.
Camp David accords are still the leading parties to which everyone concerned with peace in the Middle East turns. Together they hold the key to progress towards peace. With its commitment to the accords, Egypt has gained in prestige and stature. Many of those in the Arab world who once attacked and boycotted it are now looking to Egypt to play a leading role in peace negotiations. The United States, of course, is equally sought after. Many have come to appreciate the positive influence it brings to bear on the political process in our region.
For its part, Israel remains anxious and willing to move the peace process forward without delay. The peace treaty with Egypt was intended to be the first in a series of treaties that together would constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.
Those who are afraid of peace or who are seeking to evade peace with Israel are trying to promote an alternative to direct negotiations, and ultimately to peace itself, through an international conference. Let me repeat again: Experience proves that the only path to peace is through direct negotiations. Substitutes for such negotiations can only lead us away from peace. The history of our region provides anple evidence of this simple truth.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly called upon King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct peace negotiations with Israel. We recognize that once he decides to respond to our call Jordan may face considerable opposition from some Arab quarters. That opposition, however, will not be deflected or appeased by such devices as an international conference. Ultimately, Jordan will have to decide whether the advantages of peace with Israel outweigh the risks and difficulties involved in making such a move. But Jordan must understand that its peace will have to be with Israel, not with an international body. The first sign of a
genuine willingness to move towards peace is a declared readiness to deal directly with one's former adversary. There is no other way to a genuine reconciliation.
We firmly believe that the absence of democracy and freedom in our region is a major obstacle to peace. Only democracy offers the guarantee of freedom, the hope of progress and the prospect of peace. We do not believe any people want war. We do not believe the Arab peoples want war. Wars of aggression are initiated by Governments that do not represent the will of their peoples and fail to reflect their aspirations. That is why we must hope that democratic Governments will prevail throughout the Middle East on a not too distant day, for on that day true and permanent peace will come to our region. To hasten the coming of that day we call on all countries interested in peace in the Middle East strongly to support direct talks between Jordan and Israel. We call on them strongly to signify their willingness to buttress and strengthen a peace settlement by declaring their readiness to endorse it immediately. In addition, the supporters of peace should undertake to extend whatever assistance and support may be needed by the Government and the people of Jordan to embark on an ambitious development Program that will accompany the implementation of the peace treaty. The rewards of peace must be swift and exemplary, and serve to belie the words of its opponents.
Our region - the entire world in fact - is plagued by the spread of Arab terrorism. There is no limit to its atrocities. Even places of worship are not immune to this wanton murder. The recent attack on a synagogue in Istanbul was merely the latest and deadliest in a series of such attacks on Jewish places of worship. But Jews are not the only victims. Arab terror has made a blood pact with terrorists from all over the world to fight the common enemy, of which Israel and Jews are merely a part. That enemy is the community of democratic nations. The fight against this menace is therefore the fight of all civilized and free nations.
The so-called PLO was the linchpin of this alliance in terror; it pioneered the art of hijacking, bombing, kidnapping and massacre on an international scale. In the decade preceding 1982 the PLO used its mini-State in Lebanon to train and arm terrorist groups from five continents, from left-wing extremists to neo-Nazi gangs. Libya, Syria and Iran joined in financing, training and arming the terrorists and providing them with safe havens.
Since our action in Lebanon in 1982, the PLO has disintegrated into a number of rival terrorist gangs, most of them mercenaries in the service of various Governments. Their one common objective is to sabotage any attempt at peace and stability. The legacy of terror that they have created has encouraged other terrorist groups, many of them possessed by a mad desire to spread anarchy and terror for no reason whatsoever.
Much has been said about ways to combat international terrorism, but little has been done. Terrorism will continue to take its toll as long as the terrorists believe they can kill with impunity and achieve legitimacy and their political goals in the process. They must be denied these victories. They must never be appeased. They must never be ""understood"". They must always be condemned and fought vigorously. If we are serious in our desire to rid ourselves of international terrorism, we must adopt a broad and comprehensive campaign against the terrorists.
We must expel the representatives of terrorist organizations, starting with the PLO, from all countries committed to the fight against terror. We should hunt down the terrorist killers. They must always be on the run. But no matter what measures we take against the killers themselves, they will not be enough. If we do not go to the source, to the regimes whose support and protection make terrorism possible, we will not succeed in rolling back the tide of terror. We must isolate
and punish those terrorist States. We should shut down their embassies, expel their diplomats, curtail trade with them, and co-ordinate a military response if they persist in attacking us. Those who refuse to address the problem of State-supported terrorism are not merely failing to solve the problem? they are
facilitating its expansion.
Last year, from this rostrum, I spoke of three major threats facing the countries of the Middle East: the escalating race in conventional arms, the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the grave problem of chemical warfare. Unfortunately, little if anything has been done to reduce those threats. In fact, in some ways the situation has worsened in the past year.
The most dramatic development has been the increased use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran. This has been investigated by the united Nations and condemned by the President of the Security Council on behalf of its members. There is also considerable evidence that other States in the Middle East, most notably Syria, are developing a chemical warfare capability. The free world should pool information on this subject and adopt concerted measures to prevent the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons. We cannot afford to cower before dictatorships that stockpile these inhuman inventories, especially since these regimes have shown no hesitation in using them.
To our disappointment, negotiations on a nuclear-weapon-free zone among the States in the region have yet to begin. It is our firm belief that, in an area as sensitive as the Middle East, the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation would be a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries were among those which supported the establishment of our State in 1948. But things have changed. With the exception of Romania, all the Eastern-bloc countries have severed their diplomatic ties with us and adopted a one-sided policy towards the Middle East. We welcome, of course, any sincere attempt at improving relations and re-establishing diplomatic ties between us and any Eastern European country.
This year, for the first time in nearly 20 years, an official meeting took place in Helsinki between representatives of Israel and the Soviet Union. We hope that it is a sign of a positive change in the policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel. Without such a renewal of diplomatic relations and without a major change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Soviet Jews - especially the policy that prevents them from exercising their basic right of repatriation to Israel - it is difficult to see how the Soviet Union could contribute in any way to the attainment of peace in our region.
The plight of our Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union has been raised countless times by Israel's representatives and by world leaders; yet the tragic suffering continues. The hope that a new leadership in the Soviet Union would bring with it an improvement in the situation of Soviet Jewry has, so far, not been borne out. The condition of Soviet Jews, especially those among them wishing to leave for Israel, has deteriorated still further.
In a country of over 100 nationalities, speaking over 100 languages, Jews remain the only officially recognized nationality in the Soviet Union denied the right to maintain its cultural heritage and pass it on to the next generation. They are forbidden to study their ancient language, Hebrew. Throughout the entire length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not a single Jewish school where Jews may study their history, literature and traditions.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Soviet Union have expressed their desire to join their people in Israel. But the Soviet authorities have effectively stopped Jewish emigration; less than 500 Jews were allowed to leave during the first eight months of this year. Thousands have had their requests for exit permits repeatedly refused on the flimsiest of pretexts; as punishment for daring to apply to leave, they have been subjected to all manner of harassment and reprisals. Among those ""refuseniks"" are the prisoners-of-Zion, who have been subjected to arrests and lengthy terms of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. The real reason for their imprisonment is painfully clear: it is their insistence on their right to emigrate to Israel and their right to study Hebrew and persevere in their Jewish heritage.
The Soviet policy towards Soviet Jews is a flagrant violation of the International Convention on Human Rights, to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. It is totally contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Accords. The refusal of the Soviet Government to fulfill its most elementary humanitarian obligations must weigh heavily in the considerations of all who would contemplate entering into agreements with the Soviet Union on any subject.
Prom this rostrum, I call upon Governments and people of good will everywhere to urge the Soviet Government to bring its behavior towards Soviet Jews into line with universally accepted international standards. We in Israel will not rest until every Jew in the Soviet Union is permitted to exercise his right to emigrate and until Jews are free to follow their ancestral traditions and faith.
Another beleaguered Jewish community are the Jews of Syria. They are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies. They are not free to live wherever they wish. Several hundred young Jewish women cannot
find husbands in the Jewish community. The Syrian Government has callously refused to allow then to leave the country so that they may marry within their faith and establish families. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return. All that, too, is another instance of flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Syria is a signatory.
None of the problems I have described, including those relating to our region, is insoluble. They can be resolved if the Governments involved muster genuine good will, we turn again to the leaders of our Arab neighbors with an outstretched hand of peace. Let us bring an end to belligerency and hatred. Let us make real the hopes for a new era of understanding and coexistence. We shall not spare any effort in this quest, nor will we give up hope that it will bear fruit.
The eyes and hearts of millions of human beings who are wasting away from hunger and poverty, who live under oppressive regimes that deny them basic human rights, who are victims of barbaric terror, are turned towards us in the hope that we can alleviate their suffering. They look to us, to this body, for the hope of a better future. We cannot let them down and still claim fidelity to the ideals of this Organization. We bear the responsibility to begin action now for their sakes and for the sake of our place in history. Let us not forsake them, or our aspirations for a better and safer world."
5,1984,"ISR_prev_1998","It gives me pleasure, Mr. President, to associate myself with the warm congratulations offered to you from this rostrum. They are a tribute to your country and to yourself, as well as to a continent which is playing such a prominent role in the United Nations. I hope and trust that, under your leadership and guidance, the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be constructive, positive and responsive to the grave problems that face us.
101.	It is gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year, reinforced with new partners in our common endeavours. The United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality. The only attitude we should disavow is the promotion of narrow, selfish interests which run counter to our common international efforts.
102.	Every session of the General Assembly must set out in a spirit of hope that, despite the disappointments of the past, we can and should renew our efforts and work for a better world. Forty years ago, the founders of the United Nations looked back on a tragic past and undertook to forge instruments that would ensure a better future for humanity. So do we, in accordance with ancient Jewish tradition, look back year after year upon the disappointments of the past with firm belief in a better future, buoyed by an unflagging hope in the triumph of that human spirit which never deserts us.
103.	The fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War will occur in 1985, as has already been noted from this rostrum. This was a landmark in history and even more so in the annals of my people. Israel and the Jewish people, who still carry so many scars of that terrible war, will commemorate the occasion appropriately. The event will undoubtedly be marked by all nations, as was indeed recommended by the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which invited States Members ""to adopt . . . measures declaring punishable by law any dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . . including Nazi, Fascist and neo- Fascist ideologies"". The Assembly also appealed to all States to accede to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. There are still a few pockets of neo-Nazism that continue to linger, and they should be dealt with firmly, but the true heirs to this inhuman creed are those organizations and Governments that continue to this day to deny the right of existence of another State and strive for its outright destruction. There should be no room in civilized society for such doctrines or for those who promote them.
104.	The United Nations concept embraces the whole of mankind. Its raison d'etre is the welfare, present and future, of humanity, with special attention accorded to the underprivileged, the disabled and the oppressed. Our special attention should be focused on the problems of children and of youth and on their appropriate education and training. This should be our central task in building up our nations and societies.
105.	The coming year will be marked by the conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women, with the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the Decade to be held at Nairobi. Our hope is that that Conference will become a high point in women's struggle for equality and will not be exploited for narrow and barren political interests.
106.	Technological progress holds the promise of providing solutions to some of the most pressing problems of developing nations, but nowhere is it more sorely needed than in the field of agriculture and food production. It is now widely recognized that the international development effort has failed to meet its most important challenge, the production of food for the fast-growing population of our world. Agriculture is the key to the present challenge, but its development and that of the rural society that sustains it have been sadly neglected.
107.	Great strides have been made world-wide in industry, in the development of infrastructure, transportation, education and health, but food production has remained deficient. It is a terribly sad comment on our society that in this modern age millions go hungry and die of famine; hundreds of millions, mainly children, suffer malnutrition, their future as productive members of their society endangered. Per capita food production in Africa, for instance, has in fact dropped 15 per cent in the last decade. Countries in other continents have required emergency food supplies. Nations that were once self-sufficient have become importers of food and, as a result of their economic difficulties stemming from the increase in the cost of energy, their true independence has become endangered.
108.	Catastrophe awaits many nations if we do not find the way to assure adequate food for our world's growing population. World security and stability begin with the assurance of basic human needs. A change of direction is thus urgently needed in the goals of international development. That is the challenge of this decade. This goal can be reached despite the scarcity of arable land and water and despite the meagre resources that are available in various countries. In fact, Israel has emerged in only one generation from severe austerity and food rationing to self-reliance; we have increased our food production twelvefold and have become a net exporter of food.
109.	Israel recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its programme for international development co-operation. This programme had its beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the emergence of newly independent nations that sought rapid development. Imbued with a pioneering spirit that thrived on successful adaptation and innovation in the development of their own country, the people of Israel considered it a duty to share the knowledge acquired through their own rapid development experience with the peoples of other emerging nations.
110.	Israel calls upon all Governments to set aside political differences and narrow economic interests to join forces in the campaign against hunger. Israel will continue to co-operate with other nations in technology and development and stands ready to join other Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in working to meet this great challenge to humanity.
111.	Israel is the fulfilment of an age-old dream and prayer for the re-establishment of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel. It is the home of all Jews who wish to make it their home, and it is the defender and protector of all Jews who are oppressed or persecuted because they belong to the Jewish people. These principles are enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence, in its laws and in the conscience of its people.
112.	We are aghast at the fact that, 40 years after the eradication of Nazism, rampant anti-Semitism and racial discrimination still exist in a number of countries. The situation of Soviet Jewry has recently taken a definite turn for the worse. From this rostrum I call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to remove the harsh limitations and restrictions imposed upon Jews who seek repatriation and reunion with their brethren in Israel. The continued harassment of Soviet Jews has become one of the most pressing humanitarian problems of the day, a violation of the most basic human rights as expressed in the Helsinki accords. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are being systematically denied their rights and many are forced to live as outcasts, deprived of their livelihood, harassed or imprisoned in gaols and labour camps under inhuman conditions.
113.	Soviet Jews are deprived of access to Jewish culture. A systematic campaign is waged against those Soviet Jews teaching and studying the Hebrew language. Ill-concealed under the cloak of anti-zionism, officially inspired anti-Semitism is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media.
114.	We call upon the Soviet Government to change its policy, which is unjustifiable. The Soviet Jews are not involved in any anti-Soviet activity, nor are they violating Soviet laws or working against Soviet interests. Their only wish is to study their ancient culture and their national language and to live as Jews in their historic homeland. It should be recalled that in front of this very Assembly official representatives of the Soviet Union have declared that the Jewish people have a right to a State of their own. Soviet Jewry demands nothing more than to exercise this right.
115.	In our own part of the world, the Middle East, the Jews of Syria continue to suffer under a harsh regime that holds them hostage and refuses to grant them basic human rights, the most important of which is the right to emigrate and join their brethren. Periodic killings of Jews, either sanctioned or tolerated by the authorities, maintain a climate of terror among the Jews of Syria.
116.	In Ethiopia, an ancient Jewish community struggles to maintain its heritage, culture and integrity under dire hardship. We acknowledge the gesture of the Ethiopian Government, which has recently enabled Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to visit that community, and we express our sincere hope that it will take all necessary steps to protect and respect their religious and cultural rights and enable those who so desire to be reunited with their families in their ancient homeland.
117.	On 13 September 1984, a Government of national unity, encompassing the overwhelming majority of political parties in Israel, was established. Its creation is a reflection of the wide consensus that unites the people of Israel on the main issues on the Government's agenda in the economic, defence and political domains.
118.	In its foreign relations, Israel is dedicated, as always, to the goal of peace and accommodation with all its neighbours. In the north, we stand ready to reach an understanding with Lebanon which will guarantee the security of our common border and thus make possible the withdrawal of all forces from southern Lebanon. Syria remains dogmatically opposed to the idea of peace with Israel. Nevertheless, we are adamant in our conviction that there can be no solution other than peace. In the east, we have repeatedly called on the Government of Jordan to join us in negotiations for peace. In the south, of course, we have peace with Egypt, but we are convinced that peaceful relations should be deepened and strengthened in the face of so much rejectionist pressure against peace.
119.	The chances of progress towards further peace and stability between Israel and its neighbours must be appraised, however, in the context of the realities of the region.
120.	The Middle East continues to be beset by violence, bitter conflicts and wars. In a few weeks of bloodshed along the Iran-Iraq border, more men and children die than in all the Arab-Israel wars. Thousands die every year in domestic strife and hostilities entirely unconnected with the Arab-Israel conflict. Yet, as everyone in this Hall knows full well, a disproportionate amount of the time of the General Assembly is devoted year after year to a contrived and counter-productive review of the Arab-Israel conflict, the main purpose of which seems to be only to slander Israel.
121.	In the last two decades, the violence and oppression that characterize so many regimes in the Middle East have erupted on the international scene in waves of terrorism, hijacking and assassination. When in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed that the United Nations promote measures to counter international terrorism, we were among the first to welcome that initiative. Regrettably, it has been thwarted by States that sponsor and support terrorism. Middle Eastern terrorism, sanctioned by these Governments, has been thus allowed, through neglect and indifference, to expand to more and more countries. Today the cancer of terrorism has spread to all continents. The latest form of terrorism and international piracy is the mines that threaten shipping and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Recently, we were again horrified by the murderous bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a calculated and deliberate act of terrorism.
122.	Terror is a malignant disease that will spread everywhere if not contained. But at least in one instance concerted international effort has produced results. When terrorism first raised its ugly head in the mid-1960s, its prime target was international civil aviation. Planes were hijacked almost daily, aircraft bombed, passengers terrorized and murdered. The proper functioning of civil aviation today is a result of powerful measures taken jointly by many nations to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft and to combat the threat of hijackings. But such successful international co-operation remains an exception. Terrorism is still an item on the Assembly's agenda, but it is debated ineffectively, shunted aside by vested interests which offer its representatives support, sustenance and even quasi- recognition. As long as the family of nations continues to evade its responsibilities, to appease rather than punish, to pardon terrorists rather than prosecute or extradite them, to afford terrorists diplomatic immunity, the disease will spread and claim yet more victims in our homes and communities.
123.	Whenever a particularly outrageous terrorist attack takes place, as for example the recent bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a wave of outrage sweeps public opinion in all parts of the civilized world. People naturally demand instant retaliation against such despicable acts and a fitting punishment for the criminal perpetrators.
124.	While punishment has its necessary place in any system of justice, the overriding problem here is not whom to punish and how punishment should be delivered. Rather, it is how to prevent terrorism and root it out from the international arena. There is only one way to deal with this problem. Those countries which agree that terrorism must be eradicated should join forces and wage a permanent war on the terrorist organizations. This is the only way to expose, pre-empt, weaken and finally destroy them. This is a war of self-defence in its true sense, a campaign that the free world should undertake on behalf of its peoples and of the entire human race.
125.	For its part, Israel has been waging an unrelenting war on Arab terrorism and has dealt it a number of crippling blows. The so-called PLO, which had established its own mini-terrorist State in Lebanon, from which it carried out and assisted terrorist acts in five continents, was expelled from that country. But Israel cannot be expected to shoulder alone the burden of fighting international terrorism. Since we are all potential victims of terror, we must fight it together. If we do not, terrorism will endanger our basic freedoms and all the standards of civilized behaviour for which the United Nations stands.
126.	The attitude underpinning Arab terrorist attacks against Israel is the continued denial by Arab States of Israel's right to exist. Translated into wanton attacks on civilians, the ideology is cruel and inhuman. But it has produced the very opposite result to that intended. Israel has taken the necessary measures to protect its people and enable them to live and prosper alongside their Arab neighbours throughout the Land of Israel. We have to state with regret that any sign of ostensible moderation in the attitude of Arab Governments towards Israel is negated by their sustenance and support of terrorist organizations committed to Israel's destruction and by their continued attempts to expel Israel from United Nations bodies and other international organizations. We will welcome a change in the Arab stance if it is given concrete expression, such as a clear-cut disengagement from the so-called PLO and other terrorist organizations and a straightforward statement of readiness to make peace with Israel.
127.	Sadly, such a breakthrough for peace was set back by the General Assembly's rejection of the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, for no other reason than that certain Arab States reject the idea of peace with Israel. Camp David has been the only ray of light in an otherwise dismal and dark picture of hostility. It will continue to serve as a beacon of hope until its message is finally accepted by the peoples and Governments of our region.
128.	The United Nations can contribute to peace in the Middle East by a change of direction. It should embrace the idea of peace between Israel and its neighbours condemn the blatant attacks on Israel and reject outright the attempts to expel it from international forums. Recently, an attempt to expel Israel from the UPU was properly rejected by an overwhelming majority. It is now time for the United Nations as a whole to muster the courage to condemn such behaviour. It will mark an important milestone in rehabilitating the image of the United Nations and its standing in the world community.
129.	Recently, the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East was resurrected. It was advanced by a State that has no diplomatic relations with Israel and that recommends the participation of representatives of terrorist groups. The Arab-Israel dispute is not in need of another international forum. There have been more than enough such gatherings and proposals, and they have all proved futile. They served as a stage for propaganda and for competition between Arab States in the politics of public confrontation with Israel. A conference such as the one being proposed would strike a blow at the principle of direct negotiations, which has proved to be the only means of producing agreements between Israel and its neighbours, from the time of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949 through the Camp David accords in 1978.
130.	We therefore call on Member States that have the interest of peace at heart to bring their influence to bear on our Arab neighbours to the east and north to adopt the only successful and tested path to peace—direct negotiations with Israel.
131.	Such negotiations produced the agreement with Lebanon which was signed on 17 May 1983. That agreement provided for security arrangements against terrorism and an agreed basis for normal relations between our two countries across the recognized international boundaries. It was approved by the legislatures of Israel and Lebanon, but Syria and those that cannot tolerate the idea of peace with Israel destroyed it by the application of sheer, brutal force. The agreement was designed to lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the restoration of Lebanese independence and the establishment of security measures along the Lebanon- Israel border.
132.	Today, some 40,000 Syrian troops occupy 65 per cent of Lebanon and show no sign of any intention to leave. The Lebanese Government is dominated by Syria and is not capable of conducting free negotiations that would resolve its problems with Israel. Obviously, Israel will ensure its legitimate security needs and make the necessary arrangements in southern Lebanon to protect the people of northern Israel against any repetition of the terrorist attacks of recent years. I reiterate our readiness to withdraw all our forces from Lebanon, subject to the above-mentioned arrangements.
133.	By now it should be clear to everyone, including the Arab States in our area, that Israel has no interest in maintaining any military presence in Lebanon. But we have to make certain that after the last Israeli soldier leaves Lebanon, the terrorists will not return to attack us.
134.	Let me repeat: anyone, any people or State that is interested in the evacuation of the Israel army from Lebanon must see to it that the terrorist organizations expelled from Lebanon by Israel do not return to our borders to renew their attacks. This is an essential condition for peace. Israel is ready to cooperate in any serious effort towards a fair solution to this problem.
135.	Since the conclusion of the Camp David accords, Israel has repeatedly called on Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Arabs to join in negotiations for an agreement on autonomy. Unfortunately, Egypt has discontinued its participation in the talks, while Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs have refused to join them. Arab rejectionism and extremism continue to have a stranglehold on those who may have been willing to embark on the path of moderation and peace.
136.	From this rostrum, I turn yet again to our neighbours with the same call. Let us move forward together on a new path. Let us talk to one another. Let us engage in a common effort to resolve our conflicts, rather than perpetuate the negative attitudes which find frequent expression in this building.
137.	Until this call is heeded, Israel will continue to strive for an end to Arab rejectionist attitudes and aspire to mutual acceptance, tolerance, understanding and dialogue, which are consonant with the most basic goals of the United Nations.
138.	Israel is aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and of the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international arrangements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
139.	Israel has long been concerned by the dangers posed by nuclear armaments and has therefore consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
140.	We believe that the most credible barrier to proliferation in such a sensitive area as the Middle East is a freely negotiated nuclear-weapon-free zone. In this belief, we are encouraged by the Latin American experience and the recent progress towards establishing the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon- free zone.
141.	In the vital field of disarmament, we are impelled by a permanent moral imperative. Progress in this field is indispensable if we are to remove the nuclear threat. It may be a commonplace to say that time is running out, but it is nevertheless true. A very recent experience demonstrates that weapons, once they exist, are used. During the current terrible Iran- Iraq war, new non-conventional weapons, such as gas, have been used. This latest addition to the arsenal of fighting armies, against established international conventions and basic decency, cannot but arouse the deepest anxiety. It should be opposed vigorously by anyone concerned for the future of our civilization. All of us are aware that a moderation of the armament spiral, both conventional and non- conventional, will free huge resources needed for the welfare of mankind, in particular that of the developing countries.
142.	In conclusion, our mission is twofold. Our first task is the improvement of the quality of life in this world, especially for those who are suffering or who lack the means of sustenance; the hungry millions are waiting for us to do our duty. Our second task is to concert our efforts to eradicate from our midst terrorism and all other violations of civilized norms. We must dedicate equal effort to achieving both goals. We cannot accomplish our humanitarian task unless we overcome the dangers that threaten our society. Both objectives can be achieved provided we muster the courage and the will to do so. Our reward will be true peace. There can be no greater goal for the United Nations.
143.	The vision of our ancient prophets of universal peace was intended for a distant, Utopian future. But, if we succeed in removing these two formidable obstacles—hunger and terrorism—from our path, the march of humanity towards the fulfilment of that vision will be immeasurably advanced, our stride quickened and our hearts uplifted with the promise of better days."
5,1978,"ISR_prev_1998","70.	Mr. President, permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in this general debate by offering you the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will guide this session with fairness and wisdom.
71,	It is my pleasure also to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
72	As we reflect upon the work of the United Nations over the past year one undertaking stands out above all others: it is the noble attempt to reach an agreement on disarmament, to divert precious resources to improving the lot of the common man
73	In the Middle East we recently witnessed an unprecedented escalation in the quantity of weapons purchased by the Arab States, amounting to $11 billion in orders since the beginning of 1977. Indeed, over the past five years the arms agreements signed by those States mean that they have outstripped both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries members of the Warsaw Pact Organization in the ratio of their arms build-up.
74.	Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race and it remains ready to enter into agreements on arms limitation with all States in the Middle East. There is no doubt, however, that the appropriate way to bring about an arms reduction in the Middle East is through peace treaties which would include limitations on armaments within their framework Indeed, the mere transformation from a state of war to one of peace will move the States involved to dedicate their resources to economic development rather than military aims.
75.	Terrorist groups continue to threaten the lives of innocent men, women and children in different parts of the world. Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries did not continue to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. Yet we are gratified that States which once stood helplessly by have begun to assert themselves.
Mention should be made, for example, of the Federal Republic of Germany's rescue operation in Mogadishu and of the joint statement on international terrorism of the Heads of State 'or Government at the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference,6 wherein they recognized the need for immediate action to cease all flights to and from a country which refuses to extradite or prosecute hijackers of aircraft. It is only through such concerted and effective action that the world can be freed from organized terrorism.

76.	In the field of human rights no State should ignore a violation of human rights wherever it may occur in the world.
77.	Israel continues to follow closely the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. We welcome the recent increase in the number of exit visas issued, although a large number of Jews are still denied the elementary human rights to emigrate. In addition, administrative obstacles and arbitrary restrictions still threaten the social and economic livelihood and personal freedom of Jews seeking to emigrate.
78.	We have been particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences passed this year on Jews whose only crime is their desire to rejoin their families in Israel-Grigorij Goldstein, Iosif Begun, Ida Nudel, Vladimir Slepak, Simon Shnirman and Anatoly Scharansky. Those sentences caused bitter protest and indignation throughout the world. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and allow those who want to emigrate to Israel and rejoin their families to do so.
79.	We cannot be silent in the face of the increasing incitement of feeling against and defamation of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, their religion, culture and national movement, manifested day after day in the official Soviet media. Those anti-Semitic attacks, unprecedented in their intensity, may have most dangerous consequences. In this regard it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their ancient traditions and culture, and in fact take severe measures against Jews who wish to do so. We appeal Jo the Soviet Union to allow Jewish culture to be expressed freely.
80.	We also deeply regret that the Syrian Government continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and be reunited with their relatives residing in other lands.
81.	One of the most important trends in world , politics today remains the determined aspiration of the new and under-developed nations to take their place in the international political and economic arena. Being a developing nation itself, Israel strongly identifies with the aspirations of nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America to transform their political independence into a full and equal economic partnership with the older-established nations of the world.
82 To that end the North-South dialogue, with its guidelines on the transfer of resources, marks an important
beginning, and the Government of Israel appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies in encouraging this process. My Government particularly welcomes the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires, where Israel proposed a voluntary agreement for the exchange of technical assistance among developing countries. Israel has been co-operating for more than 30 years with other developing nations in fields such as irrigation techniques, seed production, desalination, solar energy and the agricultural development of arid and semi-arid zones. We view the expansion of such co-operative efforts as vital if the serious food shortages that still exist in so much of the world are to be overcome .
83.	A year ago I addressed this Assembly on the prospects of launching a peace process in the Middle East. Today I have the satisfaction of being able to address the General Assembly on the new and positive developments that have taken place recently.
84.	As all members of the Assembly know, a few weeks ago at Camp David two framework agreements8 were signed by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and witnessed by President Jimmy Carter of the United States of America. Within a very few days from now negotiations will start between Israel and Egypt for the conclusion of a peace treaty between them.
85.	It is my hope that these negotiations will be successful and that before the year is out we shall witness the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. It is our desire that the peace process should eventually embrace the other States that are our neighbours—Jordan, Lebanon and Syria-so that we may achieve a comprehensive settlement in the area.
86.	The gratitude of my country goes out to President Jimmy Carter, whose devoted efforts have made the Camp David developments possible When this achievement ends with an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, President Carter's name will be recorded in history as that of a great peacemaker.
87.	I also wish to express my country's deep appreciation to President Anwar El-Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt for his wisdom and faith. His visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 turned a new page. He decided to enter into negotiations with Israel, to recognize Israel and to make peace with Israel. This change in policy ushered in a historic change in the relations between Egypt and Israel. The previous policy based on the ""three Nos"" of Khartoum 19679—no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel—prevented any progress towards a peace settlement.
88.	Now the road to peace lies open. The warm reception accorded to President El-Sadat by the people and Government of Israel constituted an acknowledgement of this change in the Egyptian policy. A new era of peace, for which Israel has been longing since its establishment, has started. Prime Minister Begin's courage and leadership were a decisive factor. Without his readiness and ability to assume responsibility for very painful decisions, the achievements reached at Camp David would not have been conceivable.
89.	Not only since the founding of the State of Israel but since the very beginning of the Zionist movement our dream has always been of a Middle East in which Jew and Arab would live in harmony and co-operation for the mutual advantage of both peoples.
90.	The Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is a step in this direction. It provides for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilian population from Sinai; for the establishment of normal relations between the two countries, including diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and full recognition; the termination of economic boycotts and of barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and mutual protection of citizens by due process of law. It also stipulates that there shall be free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, and that the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba are international waterways to be open to all nations for navigation and over flight.
91.	In view of the several wars launched by our neighbours, we are conscious of our security needs. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of normal relations between the two States, there will be security arrangements concerning the limitation of armaments and forces in the different areas on the basis of reciprocity.
92.	Moreover, the framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel also provides for the stationing of United Nations forces at Sham el Sheikh to ensure freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran. Similarly, there is a provision for their being stationed in northern Sinai, thus creating a ""buffer zone"" between the forces stationed in El-Arish and those in Gaza. These forces will not be removed unless such removal is approved by the Security Council of the United Nations. It should be noted here that in recent years the United Nations forces in the Middle East have played a constructive role with the framework of the various agreed arrangements in the. region.
93.	It has never been the wish of Israel to exercise control over the lives and activities of the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza.
94.	We want to live as equals with the Arab inhabitants of those areas. We want to live with them, not to replace them; but at the same time we do not regard ourselves as foreigners in those areas. The Israeli settlements in Judaea and Samaria and in the Gaza district are there as of right. It is inconceivable to us that Jews should be prohibited from settling and living in Judaea and Samaria, which are the heart of our homeland.
95.	We maintain our army positions in those areas in order to ensure the security of the population of Israel, the majority of whom live in the Mediterranean coastal area. The Israeli forces are there in order to protect Israel and not in order to interfere in the lives of the Arab inhabitants. Under the agreement for the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn from those areas once a self-governing authority is freely elected by their inhabitants. The Israeli defence forces will be redeployed in those areas and maintained for security purposes. The final status of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza and their relationship with their neighbours will be negotiated during a period of five years following the establishment of the self-governing authority.
96.	One of the subjects that will be discussed between the parties will undoubtedly be the question concerning Jerusalem. For us, the city of Jerusalem is the one and only eternal capital of Israel. We have not, and we shall never have, any other capital city, whether or not others recognize it as such. This eternal city is holy to three religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. However, our connexion with it is not just religious, but derives from the totality of Jewish national history. Jerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. It is now united once again, as it should be, free and open for all to come and go. All religious communities should be in complete control of their own holy places and of their own religious life, and all should enjoy the rights of free worship. The inhabitants of the city should live together in harmony with a representative municipal council supervising all essential functions. We have resolved never again to compromise the unity of Jerusalem, and it is our hope that other peoples will share our position.
97.	It was agreed at Camp David that a peace settlement in the Middle East should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council. Resolution 242(1967) is a carefully worked out set of principles establishing a framework of peace to be negotiated among the contending States. It makes clear mat the final borders must be negotiated bilaterally among the States concerned.
98 Let us hope that all those whose co-operation is essential in obtaining peace in the Middle East will not short-sightedly remain outside the peace process. We have to find agreed and appropriate ways for Jews and Arabs to live together in equality, trust and mutual respect.















"
5,1985,"ISR_prev_1998","Sir, at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for the fortieth session. I am convinced that your wealth of diplomatic experience and proven skills will contribute to the enrichment of the deliberations during this special session.
This year we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established with many hopes and expectations in the aftermath of a world distraught by death, destruction and the plunder of war.
Like many other peoples, but significantly different from them, the Jewish people underwent an ordeal which will leave its eternal mark not only in the long annals of its history but also in its deeper spiritual and psychological experience. This was, of course, the horrendous Holocaust which was wrought upon us by nazism and anti-semitism. For this reason the emergence of the United Nations provided a source of inspiration and light for us at the end of a very dark era in our history.
Indeed, what could be more stirring than the unequivocal declarations of principle appearing in the opening paragraphs of the United Nations Charter, such as: ""We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and the call ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors""? To my great regret, however, this Organization has had a part in shattering these aspirations and noble ideals.
The slander of anti-semitism has also been propagated in the guise of anti-zionism. In this context, we sadly note the tenth anniversary of the passing of the infamous General Assembly resolution falsely equating the Jewish National Liberation Movement - Zionism - with an outrageous phenomenon totally alien to the most fundamental and spiritual values of the Jewish heritage. That resolution, 3379 (XXX), of 10 November 1975, will be remembered in the history of the United Nations as a terrible blot on its record and a discredit to the Organization and to those irresponsible Members that supported it.
Other international forums have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda and political warfare against Israel, distorting the real purposes for which they were established. It would, therefore, be appropriate and timely to strive for what I would call ""political disarmament"" in these bodies, in order to guarantee that they maintain their integrity and credibility in the exercise of their legitimate functions.
Israel was established in 1948 against the background of a United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The United Nations, however, did nothing to implement its resolution, and the State of Israel came into being through the will, the toil and the sacrifice of its people. Nor, I might add, did the United Nations alleviate the immense threats and dangers that Israel had to face since its establishment.
Since the founding of the State we have made every possible effort towards the achievement of peace and the normalization of relations with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our national heritage. The Jewish people is a small, democratic and free people, striving to rebuild its renewed nationhood in its ancient homeland. We cherish peace and we teach its blessings to our children. Indeed, after a prolonged period of strife and hostility forced on us by our neighbors, we found a way to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
Egypt and Israel have demonstrated clearly that face-to-face negotiations and direct dialog are the most constructive and beneficial ways of achieving peace. This was brought about on the basis of the Camp David Accords, which established a just and effective framework for the settlement of conflicts. It is for this reason that Israel is so insistent on applying this framework to the further extension of the peace process. We hope that in the near future we shall be able to negotiate with Jordan, our neighbor to the East. It is crucial that the peace treaty with Egypt should not remain the sole example of peace with our neighbors, and therefore we earnestly seek to widen and deepen that peace by extending the process to include the rest of our Arab neighbors.
From this rostrum I once again urge King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct negotiations with Israel - not in some vague, deflecting international forum, but in direct, bilateral discussions. An international conference is a means of evading direct negotiations. It will be a stage for hostile and extreme propaganda and will not serve the cause of peace. Our aim should be the achievement of a bilaterally negotiated peace treaty between our countries. There is no change in our deep commitment to the Camp David accords, and we stand ready therefore to meet a Jordanian delegation, which may include Arab Palestinians from Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or other Arab Palestinians to be mutually agreed upon.
Israel firmly believes that there is no way to solve the problems of our region except through negotiations and peace. If King Hussein has finally decided to offer his hand in peace, let him act the way the late President Sadat did. He should not drown the quest for peace in a sea of conditions that nullify any chance of peace - conditions such as an international conference and the participation of terrorist organizations in the peace process. I should also like to urge King Hussein to free himself at this eleventh hour, from the clutches of the PLO. King Hussein has been caught in their clutches before and it seems that he has failed to learn from his own experience. Only after freeing himself from his dangerous association with the PLO terrorists will it be possible to achieve progress towards peace between Israel and Jordan. Indeed, the recent marked increase in terror attacks against Israelis stems, among other things, from Hussein's partnership with the PLO. Jordan cannot extend the olive branch of peace on the one hand and play host to terror at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.
Our position in this regard is clear and decisive. We are firmly against any contacts or dealings with terrorists or their representatives - and, in this case, with an organization whose declared purpose is the liquidation of Israel. PLO leaders have been intimating that they are engaged in the political process of peace. However, they have been waging cruel and murderous terrorist activity all along. According to their declared program, political action and terrorist activities should go hand in hand until they achieve their goal, the elimination of Israel. He are not ready to negotiate with terror. There is no place for its self-proclaimed representatives at a table where peace, security and tranquility are to be negotiated. Acknowledging that organization would be tantamount to legitimizing terror, and should be rejected by all those who value peace.
To protect our people and territory from terror, we were obliged to act against the PLO terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, which posed an intolerable threat to our people in the Galilee region.
Meanwhile, terror continues to wreak havoc in Lebanon. The latest outrage was the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats in Beirut. Kidnapping and the holding of hostages for ransom is only one of the manifestations of international terrorism, whose linchpin is the PLO, which we roust fight and stamp out. This is another example of the fact that terror knows no bounds, neither political nor any other.
The removal of the various threats from Israel's northern border continues to be an important priority for us. We will do all in our power to defend and protect the population of the north. This objective has become no less important in the wake of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanon, in accordance with the decision of the Government of Israel of 14 January 1935.
Yesterday Israel took action against terror bases, this time in Tunisia. Israel's air force acted against the terrorists only after it became evident that the terrorists were mounting attacks from Tunis with impunity. Only last week, PLO terrorists, who were directed and commanded from Tunis, attacked an Israeli boat in Larnaca, Cyprus, and murdered three Israeli civilians in cold blood. In recent months, those headquarters were responsible for a number of seaborne attempts
against our people, which were prevented by Israel's navy. We had no intention of attacking Tunisia, although that country has permitted terrorist bases to exist on its soil. We acted against murderous criminals in order to prevent the continuation of their criminal acts.
The United Nations has been sadly remiss in meeting the challenge of international and PLO terror. It could and should have come out resolutely against this evil phenomenon of our time and placed it outside the pale of civilization. Instead, it has equivocated and, worse, legitimized terror in terms that have provided encouragement to the terrorists and their supporters.
I regret to state that, in spite of numerous outrages and continuing attacks by PLO terrorists, this issue has never been seriously addressed by the Security Council or other United Nations and international forums. Israel cannot be expected to ignore this double standard. In spite of this, Israel is willing to act with other free nations to curb, if not stamp out, terrorism. Similarly, we urge joint international action against terrorists and their sponsors.
Among the most distressing and oppressing phenomena of our international experience is racism. The very word evokes dark and brutal memories of the long history of the Jewish people. Apartheid is a system of discrimination which the Jewish faith and the State of Israel totally reject and repudiate. The Government of Israel, on 11 August 1985, reiterated that it is unconditionally opposed to the policy of apartheid in South Africa and to any discrimination on grounds of race, religion or color or on any other grounds.
Israel has diplomatic relations with some of the African States and we are ready to renew our relations with those with which we do not have them. This is, of course, up to them. We believe that many have by now seen who the real friends of Africa are: it is not those who use high-flown words but will not lend a helping hand in time of need and distress, or those who remember Africa only when they need its votes at the United Nations. The State of Israel, in contrast, was one of the first to reach out to the nations of Africa, in their early years of sovereignty and statehood and in their current travails, and we are ready to increase our efforts.
In the area of disarmament the nations of the Middle Bast are confronted with three main challenges. These are the reduction of conventional arms, the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the eradication of the use. of chemical warfare. My Government believes that concerted regional action on all three issues is a moral imperative of the highest priority.
Concerning the accumulation of conventional arras, Israel voices its concern over the accelerated supply of large quantities of weapons to a number of belligerent Arab Governments in our region. These regimes do not need these arms for their defense, but are stockpiling them to use against Israel. This can only serve to undermine the chances for peace in the Middle East.
On the subject of nuclear weapons, we believe that the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation in so sensitive an area as the Middle Bast is a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, based on a system of obligations binding' on all States concerned. Israel stands ready to begin such negotiations without delay or preconditions.
While Israel is conscious of the necessity to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are also aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful use of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international agreements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
Another issue that arouses the deepest anxiety is the repeated use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and the danger that such use may spread in a manner that could not easily be reversed, if at all. It is tragic that the sixtieth anniversary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbidding the use of such weapons should be commemorated in this manner. This total disregard for solemn international legal obligations by Iraq demonstrates the difficulty of achieving genuine disarmament. But we must not despair; we must continue our efforts in this vital field of human endeavor.
The deteriorating situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union obliges us once again to speak out in defense of their elementary rights. Our concern relates especially to the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who have indicated their desire to join their people in Israel. The Soviet authorities, however, in flagrant violation of the Helsinki Final Act and many other international obligations assumed by the Soviet Government, refuse them permission to leave.
Many of those Jews who have been denied permission to leave are forced to live as outcasts from Soviet society, subject to all manner of official harassment and persecution, while being effectively deprived of the means of legal redress. Increasing numbers have been engulfed in recent months in an accelerating wave of arrests, trials and savage sentences of imprisonment on trumped-up criminal charges. Jews seeking to disseminate knowledge of the Hebrew language have been prominent among these recent victims of judicial repression. These Jews are in no way violating Soviet law, nor are they involved in any form of anti-Soviet activity. Their real crimes, in the eyes of the authorities, are their persistent demand to leave for Israel and their efforts, in the face of strenuous official opposition, to perpetuate their Jewish heritage, culture and religion.
All of these outrages are taking place against the background of a relentless campaign of anti-semitic incitement, usually camouflaged as anti-zionism, in the officially controlled media - a campaign designed by the authorities to encourage an attitude of suspicion, hatred and contempt towards Soviet Jews on the part of the Soviet population.
We call upon all persons of goodwill and all Governments in the civilized world to join us in our protests and in urging the Soviet authorities to conform their policies towards Soviet Jewry to the international obligations solemnly undertaken by the Soviet Government.
Israel seeks good relations with all States including, naturally, the Soviet Union. We have looked to the new Soviet leadership for signs of change in its attitude towards Soviet Jewry. Regrettably, so far we have seen no positive changes whatsoever. .We therefore have no choice but to continue to expose energetically and protest vigorously these flagrant violations of the rights of our fellow Jews seeking to join their people in Israel. He shall continue to do so untiA every Soviet Jew who so wishes is free to exercise this basic right.
There is also the problem of the Jews of Syria, who are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies and are not free to choose to live wherever they wish. This is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Syria is a signatory. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return.
Several hundred young Jewish women remain unmarried because of the depleted male Jewish population in Syria. The Syrian Government has cruelly refused to allow those women to leave the country in order to be able to marry within their faith and establish families.
tJe are also concerned about the small, ancient Jewish community left in Ethiopia, because of its isolation and suffering and the latest disasters that have befallen that country. Some of these Jews have already returned to their historic homeland and have been received as long-lost brothers and sisters who have finally returned home.
The people of Israel and its Government have expressed their solidarity with the Ethiopian people, which has undergone much suffering as a result of the recent famine and other difficulties. We appeal to the Ethiopian Government to respect the cultural and religious rights of the Jewish community and to enable it to continue to maintain its heritage and religion and, on humanitarian grounds, to permit those among them who so desire to be reunited with their families in Israel.
The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations may be a fitting occasion for a review and reappraisal of its activities, in frank and constructive self-criticism.
The United Nations should not merely celebrate its past but also plan for its future.
Some may feel disheartened by the fact that, after so many years of United Nations preoccupation with the problems of the developing countries, we still remain so distant from the goal of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich nations of the world. Poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease still characterize the conditions of life in many parts of the world.
One inescapable conclusion is that progress has too often been hampered by a tendency to substitute slogans for serious plans of action. Meeting the world's pressing economic and social problems will require new dimensions of international co-operation. The danger of famine continues to afflict developing countries. There is dire need for urgent action by the world community. The peoples of Africa are struggling to free themselves from the curses of poverty and hunger, and the rest of the world must help them in this struggle.
The vital element of developing traditional agriculture has been sorely neglected. Israel is now preparing an aid proposal for more efficient food delivery systems that would provide better nutrition and would link such aid with land and water development programs.
The success of integrated rural development has been proved in Israel's own rapid agricultural development. Israel has much experience in the proper use of soil and water, marketing organization, agro-industrial systems appropriate for developing countries, and the integration of populations and development projects. He are ready to share our know-how in these fields with other developing countries. The benefits of this experience can contribute to raising living standards in many societies.	4
Israel has presented to international organizations, both within and outside the United Nations, a development proposal entitled ""Transitional Economy"". It seeks to break the vicious circle of poverty by improving the productivity and quality of life in developing countries. The proposed program seeks to combine a comprehensive development process with decentralized planning and implementation.
In the 26 years of Israel's involvement in international development efforts, Israel has co-operated with more than 100 countries and trained over 50,000 men and women in agriculture, in rural development and in health and education. During Israel's development it encountered some of the same problems that are now facing African countries and has successfully overcome them.
The United Nations may recapture some of its prestige and authority if it gives priority to these pressing social and economic issues. The magnitude of the tasks before us will require unprecedented international co-operation.
Unfortunately, the United Nations record is not very encouraging. At its last session the General Assembly had 143 items on its agenda. It passed no less than 38 resolutions relating to the Middle East, out of which 37 were negative, even hostile, in their reference to Israel. Such resolutions have long ceased to attract any attention or carry any weight. Yet the General Assembly did not see fit to address itself to such danger-spots as the Iraq-Iran war and Afghanistan, or to many of the socio-economic problems which plague our society.
Let us put aside the political differences that beset our world and join forces in an effort to find solutions for the ordinary man, woman and child, who are too often ignored in the heat of political debate. Let us work together in the spirit of the ancient prophets who gave to the world the concept of the brotherhood of man, a concept which has been the basis for the great ideals of mankind.
In the present age of unprecedented opportunities, Israel calls upon all Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations to rise to the challenge offered by science and technology. Let us share the fruits of scientific and technological advances to improve our lives. Let us build a moral and prosperous future to achieve justice and dignity for all. Let the United Nations become, truly, a ""United Nations for a better world""."
5,1996,"ISR_prev_1998","Allow
me first, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his
unanimous election as President of the General Assembly
at its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I
would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas
do Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried
out his duties.
The succession of Governments, which is a defining
principle of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to
power a new Government in Israel. A section of the
international community has deemed this democratic Israeli
choice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against
regional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to
make a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for
peace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers
on one side and mischief-makers and people who reject
peace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right
converge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and
differences notwithstanding.
I wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab
peace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding
the practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new
majority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve
peace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding
landmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The
Madrid Conference, to which I had the honour of
contributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of
peace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are
the direct heirs.
The firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government
with respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the
peace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and
Jordan, helped to shape. However, my Government’s swift
engagement in the peace process has been minimized,
reduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel
and I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian
Authority have been met with sarcasm and given only
secondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely
with the substance and the content of peace. They
initiated the ways and means necessary for the
achievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of
the Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian
recognition to new sections of society and Israeli political
classes. It is Israel’s determination to reach peace
according to the policies and fundamental guidelines of
the new Government.
On its road to peace, the Government of Israel is
guided by several principles, which I would like to
expound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a
blind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a
region where, unfortunately, threats and instability still
rage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture
of peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along
behind a process in which terrorism and violence have not
yet spoken their last word.
Negotiations themselves, through their joint creative
energies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The
battle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its
sources of financing and assistance is not only for us to
fight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations
relentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It
is imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process free from violence.
I have just returned from the Washington summit,
held at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of
the Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this
rostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State
of the United States for their exemplary contribution to
peace by bringing the parties together and for their
profound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.
In this respect the role and contribution of the United
States remain of great importance.
On Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will
convene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in
respect of the various agreements. We are responsible to
our people and to our whole region in this matter. We
must therefore display good faith and mutual
understanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send
out the message of stable peace and lasting security.
12


The Washington summit reconfirmed the principles
and guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself
wholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-
to-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the
key to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the
renunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of
mutual efforts for peace.
The choice is in our hands. Will we opt for
cooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we
revert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and
violence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,
Israel has chosen hope.
Another major principle in our search for peace is the
will of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.
Regional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace
and stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic
hegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of
regional cooperation. This is a basic principle of
normalization. Peace and normalization are one and
indivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of
peace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization
taken hostage and brought to a halt.
Israel makes no secret that normalization of its
relations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.
This means comprehensive political and economic relations,
and the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual
acceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a
body foreign to the region. Normalization must erase
forever the residue of this ideological negation.
Normalization is the indispensable cement for keeping
together the edifice of peace.
One of our immediate goals is the resumption of
negotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid
principles, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two
countries. We recognize Syria’s important role in the
establishment of lasting peace in our region. From this
rostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume
negotiations.
As to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with
Lebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon
can be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and
the building of peace.
Egypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our
partners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have
always been engaged in all stages of the peace process.
Jordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the
building of peace in our region. A man of peace and
dialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively
supported the peace process and has provided a vital
guarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed
his complete support.
On the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,
the country of my birth and family roots, has always
walked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab
reconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King
Hassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-
Israeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his
essential role and breathe into peace the remarkable
inspiration of his solidarity.
I would like to pay tribute also to the active support
of Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania
have all helped to consolidate peace efforts.
The peace process has benefitted from the
considerable support of the co-sponsors, the United States
and Russia, and from the active and positive contribution
of the European Union and Norway and of Powers such
as Japan and Canada.
Once again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’s
irreversible commitment and determination to pursue the
path of peace.
Since the dawn of history our region has been a
meeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a
vibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the
crossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East
must, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this
place and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs
and Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to
regenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and
humanity.
Through international cooperation, Israel is sharing
with young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin
America to China, its achievements and assets in the
fields of agriculture, health and science.
We hope that the day will come when a regional
security system will be established in the Middle East to
provide a cooperative multilateral response to all security
problems. The advantage of this regional approach is that
it is based on direct negotiations between the States of the
region. The first stage is to build confidence, and
thereafter we must put arms control and disarmament
13


mechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the
establishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security
Working Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope
that in the future this framework will encompass all States
of the Middle East.
Israel’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set
ambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and
realistically. After peace and reconciliation have been
established among all the States of the region, Israel will
endeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as
ballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to
rigorous verification.
Negotiations to establish such a zone will commence
following the signing of bilateral peace accords between
Israel and all the countries of the region. In the meantime
Israel will implement confidence-building measures that
will increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make
a contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed
conflict.
We generally prefer regional security arrangements.
However, Israel is in favour of the implementation of
certain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control
and disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel
signed the Convention on conventional weapons and
adopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of
anti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty
against the use of chemical weapons and now the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will
consider ratification of that Treaty depending upon
developments in the region, particularly the adoption of that
Treaty by the major countries.
Israel has thus demonstrated its determination to be
involved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the
international community to prevent the spread of
conventional and non-conventional weapons.
Israel strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged
member of the family of nations represented in this
Organization. We note with regret and deep disappointment
that the question of our membership in a regional group has
still not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right
available to all States Members of the United Nations to
participate on an equal footing in all its activities. This
impairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations
under the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this
injustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able
to act within this Organization on the same footing as all
other Member States.
It is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name
is invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to
conclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great
religions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and
ensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression
for all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality
to which Israel has made a profound contribution.
Jerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,
has throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the
summit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in
ancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the
capital of any country other than Israel.
Rarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied
the right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people
of peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,
has returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:
Jerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving
devotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of
peace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shall
tirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.




"
5,1997,"ISR_prev_1998","I would like to begin by
congratulating the President on his unanimous election to
preside over the fifty-second session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this
session the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations
closer to each other and in finding ways to address the
challenges that face all countries and nations, north and
south, east and west.
I also wish to congratulate his predecessor,
Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in
which he carried out his duties.
We mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the
peace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,
Menachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar
Sadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their
courageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first
peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.
Throughout their entire history, the people of Israel
have aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant
call for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any
effort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,
a partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek
channels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.
In recent years, since 1991, after the principles for
negotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at
Madrid, we have achieved a number of important
advances with the establishment of full peace between
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the
signing of interim accords with the Palestinians.
Nevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and
negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and
Lebanon still lie ahead of us.
Immediately after the last elections, the Government
of Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the
Oslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the
past year we have spared no effort to implement those
accords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood
of the entire process has been undermined as a result of
the failure of the Palestinians to carry out their
commitments according to the agreements they have
signed.
In the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we
have endured many tests and have suffered ongoing
terrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration
for peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the
shedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,
women and children cut down by barbaric terrorist
attacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over
the loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has
not been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of
Israel.
The citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves
great risks for peace, but there is none among them who
is willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being
demanded in the name of peace. We must break this
tragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in
confronting the terror that trust will be re-established and
the doubts regarding intentions be removed.
As I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of
this Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for
peace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both
right and left are united in this quest.
If trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity
is honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We
have already proved our willingness to do so, through our
decisions and actions since taking office and in the
signing and implementation of the Hebron agreement in
all its aspects.
Peace cannot live side by side with continued
incitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in
essence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of
25


violence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the
honouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.
These principles apply throughout the world and must
apply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel
tracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a
second track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues
unimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct
challenge and affront to the very concept of peace.
Terror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not
a spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen
terrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of
innocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare
organizations, while under this cover they contribute to the
preparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.
Terror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any
moment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie
in its path.
Those who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill
Israelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be
accepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It
must be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must
be fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its
constant threat.
The words of the President of the United States and of
the Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few
days ago are important and should guide us all in this
matter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this
very rostrum:
“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable
political act.” [See Official Records of the General
Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th
meeting]
Thus, the international community bears the responsibility
for ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,
recognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.
In the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority
and Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the
Palestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this
commitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again
one year ago at the Washington summit and again in the
Hebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been
proved that this commitment has not been upheld as
required, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.
Israel stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian
Authority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against
terror. The Authority must act jointly and in full
cooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We
seek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the
implementation of signed agreements. The fight against
terror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian
interest.
In response to the repeated crises in the process
caused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live
up to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of
conduct for relations between us. This code should
include, first, the rejection of violence as a means for
achieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the
framework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain
from attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto
the international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of
permanent channels of communication, including in times
of crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call
to violence and jihad, and their replacement with the
language of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,
the advancement and encouragement of normalization and
support for regional activities.
The purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate
uninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to
create an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond
to the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe
that the adoption of the above principles will allow us to
overcome the present crisis and help in preventing future
ones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game
will also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders
and greater confidence between the peoples.
In the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the
United States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has
been reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace
process to its proper track. We have been conducting
intensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the
United States, both in Washington and here, with a view
to resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to
reach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.
Israel values and appreciates the action of the United
States Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts
to extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to
bring the parties closer together and to ensure the success
of the negotiations. We are fully committed to these
efforts.
26


Israel reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated
negotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on
permanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in
which the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and
the way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended
to hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to
delay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the
Palestinian Authority.
The international community can play an important
role in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which
will make it possible for us to resolve our differences
through direct negotiations. It is only through direct
negotiations that we can bring this process to a successful
conclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or
pressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the
dispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the
United Nations and other international forums only serve to
create unnecessary obstacles and to make already
entrenched positions more rigid.
The comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be
achieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and
Lebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and
agreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to
resolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to
find in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for
a just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in
favour of peace — the “peace of the brave”, as claimed by
its leadership — then we must explore together every
possible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing
the talks between us.
Israel cannot accept the continued violence and terror
on its northern border. The terrorist activities of
organizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha
rockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the
threat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.
There is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.
We wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon
acting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that
operate from its territory.
If we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only
with agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means
normalization, open borders, freedom of movement,
commerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire
region. These are the soul and essence of peace.
Normalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.
The decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab
League at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week
ago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for
peace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to
prevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of
existing relations with it, to close liaison and interests
offices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to
reactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a
boycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which
is reversing the process.
The ongoing and intentional freeze of the
multilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the
entrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant
and should serve as a platform and incentive for building
peace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral
channels alike and not make one conditional upon the
other, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road
to peace. The question mark hanging over the regional
economic conference scheduled to take place later this
year in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative
drive.
The countries of the Middle East that are party to
the peace effort have a common interest in regional
stability and the advancement of prosperity and well-
being for all the nations of the region. We face together
the growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding
desert. We are also facing dangers from within our region
that threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of
various nations and to plunge the entire region into
violence, war and bloodshed.
It was only a few years ago that the entire world
was forced into forming a coalition to combat an
aggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring
country and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face
new and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of
recent experience have not been learned and many
countries turn a blind eye to the threat.
The leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms
that threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.
Yet the international community continues to remain deaf
and refuses to speak out against Iran's policies,
declarations and actions.
Iran's efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire
operational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds
represent the greatest threat to security and stability in the
Middle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran's
weapons programme extend far beyond the geographical
confines of our region. They threaten the security of other
27


members of the international community and their interests.
Israel reiterates its call to the members of the
international family of nations — and at their head the
United States, Russia and the members of the European
Union and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —
to exercise the full weight of their influence and to take
concrete steps to prevent this development, which
represents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.
After the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties
between Israel and every country of the region, it will be
possible to create a regional security system that would
provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of
security problems in the Middle East, including a mutually
and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These
are our goals and we must act to achieve them.
Israel is an active and responsible member of the
family of nations represented in this body. However, 50
years after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November
1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the
State of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this
Organization.
We attach great importance to the fundamental reform
of the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of
other United Nations Member countries that believe that the
Organization urgently requires greater efficiency and a
redirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its
truly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced
that no reform can be completed so long as the question of
Israel's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.
We call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.
Much to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an
intensification of the political campaign waged against
Israel at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes
the peace process and further undermines confidence
between the parties. We call upon the Member States to
refrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The
time has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of
resolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and
to contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive
to direct negotiations between the parties.
As part of Israel's international and regional
commitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in
cooperative programmes with many countries, with which
we share the experience and knowledge we have acquired
in various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its
international cooperation programme and to assisting
various peoples to address the challenges of development
and the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.
Over more than three decades, tens of thousands of
trainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their
own countries within the framework of Israel's
cooperation and assistance programme in the fields of
education, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and
leadership. We are especially proud of the participation in
recent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst
them Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of
goodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the
message and the great hope of human well-being. As in
the words of the prophet:
“Each shall help his neighbour and make him
strong”.
This year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the
world marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years
ago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in
its ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our
2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we
would renew our national life in the land of our
forefathers, the land of Israel.
It is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this
aspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its
land. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its
ancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant
and democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,
research and industry.
For the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure
Israel's security and independence, while always seeking
peace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty
years on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.
This week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish
new year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye
towards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the
peace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of
hope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the
shofar is accompanied by the prayer:
“may the year and its troubles pass and a new year
and its blessings begin”.




"
5,1971,"ISR_prev_1998","60.	 Mr. President, you come to the leadership of the General Assembly at a time when eastern Asia stands in the center of international concern. It is in that region alone that war still rages day by day. It is there that a burden of suffering, unparalleled elsewhere, weighs heavily on the conscience of mankind. And it is to Asia that our eyes will turn when we come to take decisions on the future of this Organization and the principles underlying its structure.
61.	It is right at such a time that an Asian statesman of high capacity and repute should preside over our deliberations. Israel wishes you success and pledges itself to your support. You will be fortified by the high example of your eminent predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, and by the experience and patient skill of the Secretary-General, who is completing a full decade of service to the international cause.
62.	Last year the United Nations marked its twenty-fifth anniversary by an act of celebration. I suggested then that the occasion could have been more wisely used for scrutiny and self-criticism (1851st meeting]. There is a manifest decline in the influence of the General Assembly on the main issues affecting human welfare and destiny. Its resonance has diminished. The central currents of international life and policy flow outside its walls. The frustration arises, not so much from defects in the Organization's work, as from discord and contention amongst the Powers. Yet there are some causes which lie within our capacity of correction. I shall mention one.
63.	In the work of the United Nations there is a strong accent on public controversy and a relative neglect of private conciliation. A report by the Secretary-General 11 years ago contained a plea to give greater emphasis to the United Nations as an instrument for negotiation of settlements as distinct from this world debate of issues. The advice was not heeded. Debate, not negotiation, still dominates the United Nations practice. Resolutions are adopted in great numbers, but their texts bear witness to the parliamentary advantages of fragmentation rather than to a balanced view of rights or realities.
64.	For example: in a dispute in the Middle East between two parties one of which has a single vote and the other 16 or, in practice 40, the preordained triumph of automatic majorities has no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory. The same is true of the Security Council, a third of whose members have their diplomatic relations and their ethnic or sentimental predilections exclusively on one side.
65.	This difficulty would not exist if the organs of the United Nations would regard it as their main function to seek consensus which would include the interested parties. They would be better employed in encouraging agreement between the parties at issue, than in sharpening controversy between them by attempts at adjudication. In short, the United Nations should aspire to a diplomatic rather than to a parliamentary role. The test of achievement should be not how many resolutions we have voted but how many solutions we have advanced.
66.	And, indeed, wherever free, direct negotiation has taken place across the world in the past year there has been fruitful issue. There have been the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, based, as Mr. Gromyko significantly told us, ""on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers"" [1942nd meeting, para. 101]. He was referring to the frontiers established after the war by negotiation and agreement. There has been the four-Power agreement on Berlin where, as Mr. Gromyko again correctly said, it is now up to the two parties directly concerned ""to complete the negotiations between them"" [ibid., para. 98]. There has been the normalization of relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been direct contact between the United States and the People's Republic of China, to be followed at an early date by a meeting at the highest level of responsibility. The Paris talks on Viet-Nam, with the direct participation of all the parties at issue, have been accompanied by a constant de-escalation of the fighting. There is grave tension between India and Pakistan, as is evident from the general debate here earlier this week; but the two Governments have direct relations which they ca« apply to the solution of their differences. Many hearts are heavy at the reports coming from the boundary between Ireland and
Northern Ireland; but there is also news that the heads of Government concerned have met each other and agreed on a process of political reconciliation. In Washington, agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are being signed today for modernizing the ""hot line"" and strengthening safeguards against accidental war.
67.	Is there no lesson to be drawn from the settlements reached and attempted this year? Surely they show that the air is alive with a spirit of innovation. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to be an organic part of our generation's life are now yielding to a strong impulse for peaceful settlement. Above all we are learning lessons about the immense importance of communication. Time and again the decision of Governments to abandon their cold separation and make contact with each other develops from a procedural advance into a change of substantive positions and thence into binding agreements. The central themes of international life in 1971 are direct contact, the abandonment of traditional conflicts, and flexible, pragmatic negotiation.
68.	There is also a move away from dogmatic attachment to documents. If old formulas and texts have reached deadlock, new ones are sought. There is a particular recognition that after wars the need is to build new systems of relations and not to reproduce the conditions and situations out of which war erupted. This new empiricism affects the juridical domain as well. Governments which seriously seek peace do not hesitate to confer directly with Governments which they do not yet recognize and with which they have no legal relations,
69.	If there is frustration in the Middle East it is because our region is still the exception to all the positive rules which have been applied elsewhere. Whatever is tried successfully in other regions is avoided in the Middle East. Here alone there is still no contact between the parties at issue. Here alone the Governments which will have to live side by side with each other have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. Here alone we are often told that the only way to get peace is to restore the situations which erupted in war. Here alone it is said in many places that the resumption of an important peace mission is wholly dependent on a single memorandum on which there is deadlock, and that there is no room for any innovation or any versatility of formulas and techniques.
70.	It is true, despite these failures, that the situation in the Middle East today is less explosive than a year ago. The flow of events has not been backward. The cease-fire along the Suez Canal has been effective, with rare and isolated exceptions, for 14 months. Israel does not propose to bring it to an end and Egypt would achieve nothing by violating it. Indeed, the only certainty in the Middle East is that resumed hostilities would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The absence of fighting along the Suez Canal line has released the Middle East and the world from the daily prospect of escalation involving the Soviet forces which were irresponsibly introduced into the' region with the effect of aggravating and enlarging a local tension. There has been a sharp decline in the strength and prestige of the terrorist groups and the pirate organizations that loomed so large a year ago. There has been peaceful movement across open bridges into Israel and the administered territories of scores of thousands of Arabs from neighboring Arab countries which are officially ""at war"" with Israel. Thus new patterns of coexistence have grown up between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in daily life and work. Side by side with a violent and incendiary Arab rhetoric there seem to be here and there some beginnings of a greater realism in Arab thinking on the problem of Israel's sovereignty and Israel's deep roots in the life and history of the Middle East. Finally, there are three separate availabilities of good offices which, although not all in active course today, are mutually accepted by the parties: the Jarring mission; the good offices of the United States in pursuit of an agreement concerning the Suez Canal; and the intention of ten African Presidents to authorize four eminent heads of State to go to Jerusalem and Cairo on a mission of information and goodwill.
71.	Yet, with all these consolations the peace efforts are not sufficiently intense. The talks under Ambassador Jarring's auspices, which began in high promise in January, have been at a standstill since the end of February. An exchange of views and positions on a special Suez Canal agreement was inaugurated through the good offices of the United States in April. This effort is still underway, but its pace is slow. In discussing the obstacles to peace it would be easy, but sterile, to fall into recrimination. Nothing would be easier. One of the few things that all Members of the United Nations have in common is the ability to discuss each other's imperfections. Yet what mankind longs to hear is not how deadlocks arose, but how it is proposed to overcome them. The general debate will be well used if Middle Eastern States will give precise definition to what they are prepared to do in order to bring a peaceful settlement into view. All who seek an understanding of Israel's policies must come face to face with two elements in the national mood. There is a sharp preoccupation with security; and there is a vivid memory of the horror and dark peril from which we emerged four years ago.
72.	In reflecting on the theme of security, Israel cannot easily forget the immense loss and burden it has borne through the hostility directed against it for over two decades. Our danger, in 1967 was the climax, but not the whole story, of our predicament. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual survival. Israel's insistence on genuine and stable security takes particular depth from the hideous legacy of Jewish massacre in the European slaughter-house. No people in history has undergone an experience of such tragic depth and scope. And no other State has grown for 23 years amidst such a comprehensive effort to deny it every breath of life.
73.	In particular, Israel's mind preserves a permanent and,, unfading image of the danger and solitude from which it emerged in the summer of 1967. To forget or ignore these memories is to renounce all true understanding of the Middle Eastern reality today. It was only by exceptional vigilance and cruel sacrifice that we repelled a monstrous design that would have ended our people's historic journey and cast all Israel's life and achievement into the flames. Maritime blockade, terrorist incursions, military encirclement, declarations of overt war, a frenzied torrent of threats and a formal announcement from Cairo that the battle was joined for Israel's destruction all these came
together in cumulative assault,""We recall the outrageous silence and apathy with which the Security Council, between one adjournment and the next, calmly observed the only attempt in modern history to wipe a sovereign State off the map of the world. Mr. Gromyko indulges his sense of humour when he tells us that guarantees by the Security Council are among ""the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world"" [ibid.., para. 135], The truth has Iden and is that, largely as a result of Soviet policy, the Security Council for 20 years has refused to defend any Israeli right including the right not to have its citizens killed, its ports blockaded, its existence threatened. The policy of the Security Council has been to refuse to adopt any decision of which a single word is unpalatable to the Arab Governments. It has thus surrounded every assault on Israeli lives, Israeli rights and Israeli security with indulgence. At the highest point of tension and of Israel's danger in May 1967, with Israel blockaded and encircled on every side, with all mankind gripped by the apprehension of approaching war, the suggestion of the Soviet Union was that the Security Council should go home and refuse to discuss such an ""artificial"" matter as the declaration of active war and the formal imposition of a blockade against a Member State. It is largely because of Soviet policy that the Security Council cannot be a guarantor of any Israeli rights. And the future development in the composition of the Security Council, however essential for other reasons, is bound to emphasize its inability to guarantee or even to express an Israeli interest, whatever the majority of its members may think or say.
74.	There are few effective guarantees of peace beyond those inherent in the nature of the peace itself. The greatest danger is lest through lassitude of spirit or impatience or imprecision of diplomatic craftsmanship we again revert to fragile, false and ambiguous solutions, which carry in them the seed of future wars.
75.	But the work of peace, however complex, must be attempted. Israel's deepest aspiration is to take part in a new deployment of energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East. Accordingly I ask the crucial questions: Is the slow rhythm of the peace efforts inevitable? Can nothing be done or at least attempted to set some dialog in swifter motion? Do Israel's policies offer openings through which roads to peace can be discerned and actively explored? My answer is that if the Arab States, and especially Egypt, sincerely desire an honorable and lasting peace, there are many roads leading to that goal.
76.	The first road lies in a Suez Canal agreement. There are many reasons for giving priority to this at attempt. A sudden transition from a conflict of more than two decades to a total settlement has proved difficult. It may be more rational to expect progress by stages. Each stage would bring about a solution of a specific problem while opening the way to further agreements and thus to final peace.
77.	The Suez Canal sector calls urgently for disengagement. It is there that the regional tension is compounded by the military presence of a great Power. Disengagement of forces here is an urgent international interest.
78.	The President of Egypt proposed on 4 February an attempt to open the Suez Canal ahead of a total settlement.
Israel's Prime Minister responded on 9 February. Both Governments subsequently agreed that the United States should use its good offices to explore the prospect. We therefore have an agreed objective and an agreed modality. , We believe that the effort to bridge the gulf between the positions of the parties should be pursued in the general interest of peace. If agreement cannot be reached on such a clearly defined issue in which Egyptian advantage is so strong it would appear to be even more difficult to advance in one step towards an over-all settlement in which all the complex issues would Ml into place. But the contrary is also true. A concrete result in this matter will accelerate and inspire negotiation and agreements on other issues. The peace effort will acquire momentum. It will be surrounded for the first time by an air of confidence and promise.
79.	Having been invited to give its views on this matter, Israel developed a proposal that an arrangement be agreed upon with a view to the opening of the Suez Canal to be cleared and operated by Egypt. Israel would make a withdrawal of its forces from the water-line to an agreed distance. The fighting would not be resumed. Egypt would clear and open the Canal. It would be agreed that there be free passage for all ships and cargoes, including those of Israel. Effective and agreed supervision procedures would be established. Means of deterrence against the danger of violation of the agreement would be assured. The agreement would stand on its own feet, but it would not affect or annul the undertakings which the parties gave in August 1970 to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in conformity with his mandate under Security Council resolution 242(1967). The line to be held by Israeli forces in accordance with that Canal agreement would not be considered final. When agreement on a final boundary is reached in the framework of the peace settlement Israeli forces will withdraw to it.
80.	We hope that Egypt will give this proposal the detailed and careful consideration which seemed to be its intention in April. It represents far-reaching concessions on Israel's part. It involves a movement from the cease-fire line ahead of peace. It mitigates the accepted legitimate principle that no withdrawal need take place ahead of a contractual and mutually agreed peace. The prestige, benefits and revenues from the Canal, the possible return of three quarters of a million people who live near the Canal in peaceful times, as well as the crossing of the Canal by Egyptian civilian personnel, would all be Egyptian, not Israeli, gains. A new impetus would be given to the Jarring mission, which is now in abeyance. The undertakings which I have given refute the idoa that the Canal agreement would be the last word. On the contrary, its conclusion and observance would create a favorable channel for further agreements.
81.	It is true that neither Egypt nor Israel would attain its final objective in this interim framework, but Egypt's right to present its claims in the over-all peace negotiations would remain intact, as would Israel's freedom to present its own proposals and reservations.
82.	A second road to peace lies through the resumption of negotiations under Ambassado. Jarring's auspices. Israel agreed to resume these talks in January 1971 despite Egypt's refusal to rectify its violation of the missile- standstill agreement. At a meeting with the Prime Minister and myself in January, Ambassador Jarring was requested to communicate to the Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon a list of principles which, in our view, should be embodied in the peace agreements to be concluded and signed between Israel and each of the Arab Governments concerned. These principles were, at first, vehemently ""ejected by the Egyptian Government. Subsequently, on i 5 February, the Government of Egypt commented f A/8541, annex II] on an aide-memoir submitted a week before by Ambassador Jarring [A/8541, annex I], It did not accept Mr. Jarring's precise formulations on navigation in the Suez Canal, on the Straits of Tiran, nor indeed on the definition of the scope of withdrawal. But the Egyptian reply did contain an expression of readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that all the Egyptian terms for the agreement were met. One of these terms was the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip and all territories beyond the armistice line existing on 4 June 1967.
83.	In its reply on 26 February 1971 [A/8541, annex III] the Israel Government viewed favorably the expression by Egypt of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and reiterated that it was prepared for meaningful negotiation on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.
84.	Why then are the Jarring talks in abeyance? The reason is plain. The Security Council resolution, 242(1967), requires that the withdrawal and boundary clauses of the peace agreement, like all its other provisions, must be determined through agreement, which of course implies negotiation. Egypt declines to hold any dialog or negotiation whatever on this point. It lays down its own position as an ultimate condition to which Israel must submit before negotiation begins. Indeed it is not clear why negotiation would be needed at all if the Egyptian view has to be accepted in advance. In a recent declaration of which President Sadat was a signatory, three Arab Governments, including that of Egypt, reiterated that there can be no negotiation with Israel, no conciliation and no bargaining over the Palestinian issue. This is a more recent and presumably more authoritative statement of Egypt's policy than the one that Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Mr. Jarring six months ago. Together with other declarations in the same mood and spirit, it raises the question whether the February memorandum has the significance that we chose to attach to it at that time.
85.	But on one point alone the February communication from Cairo and the Damascus tripartite statement are one: they both rule out the free, precise and detailed negotiation of the ""boundary and withdrawal questions. Our policy is that, instead of cease-fire lines or armistice lines, we should establish secure, recognized and agreed boundaries as part of the peace-making process, and withdraw our armed forces to those boundaries once they are determined. It is important to break away from the temporary and unresolved territorial concepts which have prevailed since 1948 in order to develop for the first time a permanent structure of boundaries and security agreements.
86.	There is no need to be apologetic about the doctrine that peace boundaries may be different from armistice lines. The Arab Governments wrote into the 1949 Armistice Agreements a provision stating that the armistice lines are not the final boundaries and these must be worked out by agreement in the transition to peace. We are now embarked on that transition. Israel's size and strength are smaller than those of the European Powers which insisted on secure and agreed boundaries after the Second World War; but the right to negotiate boundaries that would release Israel from a chronic and desperate vulnerability belongs to it as to every other sovereign State. In this matter we are not in a position of juridical defense.
87.	I shall summarize under three headings the reasons and justifications which give Israel the right to have negotiation on boundaries and security arrangements. The first, as I have already pointed out, is the provisional character of the lines now held as well as those which existed before. Several years before the 1967 war the Deputy Foreign Minister of Egypt correctly said: ""There is no legal boundary between Israel and Egypt but only a line that was fixed in the pursuance of the Armistice Agreement.""
88.	On 31 May 1967 the representative of Jordan said in the Security Council:
""There is an Armistice Agreement. The Agreement did not fix boundaries; it fixed a demarcation line. The Agreement did not pass judgment on rights political, military or otherwise. Thus I know of no territory; I know of no boundary."" 
89.	A second and more contemporary reason in support of Israel's claim to a negotiation on withdrawal and boundaries lies in the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which has been accepted by some Arab States and by Israel and which is the constitutive document of the Jarring mission. That resolution was adopted after all attempts to require a withdrawal to the 4 June armistice lines had been defeated by vote or discarded for lack of support. The term ""secure and recognized boundaries"" was an innovation in the United Nations vocabulary. It first appeared in a United States draft resolution submitted on 7 November 1967 and later embodied in a United Kingdom draft  which was presented for unanimous vote. I must state with full solemnity and knowledge that Israel's adherence to the Security Council resolution and acceptance of the Jarring mission were secured on the most explicit understanding that the resolution offered an opportunity to negotiate agreements on boundaries and withdrawal. Secretary of State Rogers stated for the United States in October 1969:
""Those boundaries were armistice lines not final political borders. The rights, claims and positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were reserved by the Armistice Agreements. The Security Council resolution neither endorses nor precludes those armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.""
90.	In a public statement on 12 July 1970, Mr. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, declared that he had taken an active part in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). He added:
""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre- June 5 lines. The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""
91.	The United Kingdom Government, which sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967), put itself on record on 17 November 1969, when its Foreign Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, was asked:
""What is the British interpretation of the wording of the 1967 resolution? Does... it... mean that the Israelis should withdraw from all territories taken in the late war? ""
He replied:
""No, Sir. That is not the phrase used in the resolution. The resolution speaks of secure and recognized boundaries. Those words must be read concurrently with the statement on withdrawal."" 
A month later, on 9 December 1969, in the House of Commons he said:
""... There is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""?
I repeat: ""... the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""
92.	It was in the light of these clear undertakings that the Israel Government informed Mr. Jarring in August 1970 that it accepted the Security Council resolution 242 (1967) for implementation in all its parts and that on the establishment of a just and final peace in accordance with the resolution it would withdraw its forces from the cease-fire lines to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the negotiations.
93.	The political and juridical aspects of the questions to which I have referred are the expression^ a deeper, more concrete reality. Israel does not have a policy of expansion or annexation. In the negotiations on boundaries and withdrawals it will seek those modifications which are essential to ensure security and to prevent another war.
94.	ihe war of 1967 did not arise exclusively from the vulnerability of the armistice lines. But there is no doubt that some topographical and strategic situations were a permanent temptation to assault. If they are not corrected and adjusted Israel, on withdrawing from the cease-fire lines, would find itself again in a position of intolerable vulnerability. There could be no more horrifying error than to revert, through lack of precise and detailed negotiation, to a territorial structure and security balance capable of reproducing the peril which exploded four years ago.
95.	In the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai peninsula or even in most of it. But there are vital interests affecting security, peace and navigation which impel us to reserve the right to attempt in the peace negotiations to secure a contractual basis for such continued presence as is necessary to protect security and navigation. There are several juridical expressions and precedents for such an arrangement. Our emphasis is on practical security conditions, not on any particular juridical formula. The post-war map of the world is replete with instructive parallels. The peace treaties in Europe and Asia did not bring about a return to the exact military and territorial dispositions that existed before.
96.	Now Israel does not ask Egypt to accept any of its positions as a condition of negotiation. The proposal for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops to the previous positions is legitimate as an Egyptian proposal. It is equally legitimate for Israel to insist on an opportunity of free negotiation in which its own reservations and counter-proposals could be made. And our request from the world community is modest. We do not present specific Israeli proposals for endorsement by other Governments; we ask only that our right to negotiate the issues vital to our future, to our peace and to our security, should not be cut off in advance.
97.	Our position, then, is this: We have taken note of the Egyptian proposal on withdrawal. Israel would withdraw its armed forces from the Israel-United Arab Republic ceasefire line to the secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in the peace agreement. Now that both parties have presented their basic positions, they should pursue their negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior condition to cover all the points I listed in their respective documents with a view to concluding a peace agreement. I continue to adhere to the view which I expressed at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly in October 1968 that
""It is possible to work out a boundary settlement compatible with the security of Israel and the honor of
Arab States	The majority of the United Nations have
recognized that the only durable and reasonable solutions are agreed solutions serving the common interests of our peoples. The new peace structure in the Middle East, including the secure and recognized boundaries, must be built by Arab and Israeli hands"" [1686th meeting, para. 111].
Thus if Egypt will present its position for negotiation without the unprecedented request for Israel's acceptance of it in advance, we shall be ready for detailed and concrete negotiation on all the matters mentioned in the Egyptian memorandum of 15 February and the Israeli document of 26 February,
98.	Effective and versatile conciliation must include a capacity to move from one direction to another in a tireless pursuit of peace. In March 1968, Ambassador Jarring suggested a formula for the convening of meetings between the parties in Nicosia on the basis of an agreed term of reference. Egypt rejected that proposal. Those concerned with the conciliation effort did not say that the mission had to be held in suspense until Egypt gave a positive reply to something which its policy did not then allow it to endorse. It would be wrong now to affirm that such a vital objective as the establishment of a negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt will never be possible except on the basis of a working paper which did not happen to secure the agreement of the parties. Egyptian-Israeli peace is too great a cause to be tied and tethered for all time to a single optional memorandum. If Egypt will agree to pursue negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior conditions on all the points listed in the Israeli and Egyptian memoranda of February 1971, this road to meaningful negotiation will lie open,
99.	There are other roads to peace. The Suez Canal agreement and the discussion of an over-all settlement are not the only options available for negotiation. The problem of refugees requires a broad acceptance of regional and international responsibility. We have therefore proposed the convening of a conference of Middle Eastern States, together with Governments which have contributed to refugee relief and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in order to chart a five-year plan for the solution of the refugee problem and the integration of refugees into productive life.
100.	This problem would now be considered against the background of some alleviating developments in recent months. There is a growing disillusion with the irredentist pretensions of the terrorist groups and the air pirates. The dividing wall which once prevented all human contact between Israelis and Palestine Arabs is falling. It is true that this is due so far to Israeli initiative. Last year not a single Israeli set foot in any Arab land, but 110,000 Arabs from countries ""at war"" with Israel came into contact with Israel across the open Jordan bridges. An open frontier between Israel and its eastern neighbor similar to the community frontiers in Europe would do much to give human reality to a peace settlement, and indeed might help the settlement to be achieved.
101.	There is a fourth possibility. The problems of boundaries and security are usually considered to be the crux of the negotiation. But there are other unresolved matters in the memoranda presented by Egypt and Israel in February. At first sight there seems to be some proximity between the peace, non-aggression, recognition and navigation clauses suggested by the two Governments. On closer inspection the disparities are substantial, and could become crucial. We suggested in January and later in March that, it might be profitable to attempt to draft some of the clauses of the Egyptian-Israel treaty relating to the principles of peace. It is an accepted negotiating technique to begin with problems in which divergences are less broad and thus to create a favorable atmosphere in which to confront the more acute problems.
102.	There is a fifth road towards negotiating procedure and activity; it concerns the negotiating procedure, but its weight is intensively substantive and not at all procedural I have said that in the early months of 1968 Ambassador Jarring suggested meetings between the parties, under his auspices, in Nicosia, in accordance with a text setting out the terms of reference for the conferences. On 10 March 1968, Ambassador Jarring informed me that Egypt had rejected that proposal. As the Secretary-General's report of 4 January 1971 reveals, Dr. Jarring ""was informed of Israel's official acceptance, without conditions, of the text"". 
103.	Now that was the negative turning-point in the history of the Jarring mission. Since then it has been limited, through Egyptian insistence, to a bizarre procedure under which Israeli documents are presented to Ambassador Jarring, and by him to the Egyptian representative. If the Israel document contains the words ""for communication to the Government of Egypt"", the Egyptian representative refuses to take it into his h?nds; or if he has inadvertently accepted its delivery, he comes back to relinquish it with panic-stricken haste as if it were a hot coal. The Israel document is then divulged by the Egyptian representative to the press, accompanied by a burst of invective. Egyptian replies are published without any hint of an intention to communicate them to Israel. The Egyptian position is that Israel may not talk to Egypt directly, may not talk to Egypt indirectly and may not communicate anything to Egypt in writing.
104.	If no other method is available my Government will communicate its views to Egypt by whatever channel or technique is possible. But we cannot conceal our conviction that there is an element of farce in the idea that the word ""negotiation"" can honestly be applied to the extraordinary procedure followed so far. How can a Government which alleges that it wants a peace agreement with Israel refuse to negotiate the terms of that agreement by a rational method of contact? To say that one is prepared to enter into a peace agreement but not to meet or negotiate even under international chairmanship is to make a mockery of the international community. One thing is clear: No international agreement has been reached on any subject between any States at any time by the methods to which the Jarring mission has so far been confined through Egypt's insistence.
105.	I am convinced that the strongest chance of breaking out of the deadlock lies in a transition to a rational negotiating procedure. The hour is ripe. The gap between the parties is wide, but may not be impossible to bridge. Negotiation is the agent which would transform the potentiality into action.
106.	One of the most important things said about the Middle East in recent days is Sir Alec Douglas-Home's statement yesterday that ""distrust... of this depth ... cannot [easily] be removed by long-distance correspondence"" [1944th meeting, para. 98] and that ""those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog'' [ibid., para, 97], If all those who hold that view would express it with equal candor, an international movement in favor of abandoning the illusion of long- range correspondence would come to effective expression.
107.	There is no weight or value in. the argument that the Arab Governments would be negotiating from weakness if they accepted direct contact under international chairmanship. Their point of reference would be, not the military situation, but the political forum in which the Arab side would speak from a position of numerical and geographical predominance,
108.	I therefore propose to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Riad, that we take our guidance from the spirit which inspires the international life of our ags. Let us meet here this month under the auspices of the United States to discuss the details and! principles of a Suez Canal settlement; or under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jarring to discuss the establishment of peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of our respective memoranda of February 1971. Let us break out of devious procedures and sterile polemics into a new vision and a new hope.
109.	In a recent statement the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, declared that he would sacrifice a million men to achieve a military victory. What he and we should be considering is how to ensure that the 33 million Egyptians, tin 3 million Israelis and the other millions in the Middle East are saved i.om sacrifice and preserved for the construction of a peaceful regional order. The task will not be served by war or by threats of renewed hostilities which command our vigilance but which are, in effect, an echo of ill-fated bombast in the recent past. Nor will our task be fulfilled by living out the rest of 1971 in ineffective debate or inflammatory resolutions. The Arab States may have enough voting strength to secure the adoption of virulent, unbalanced texts or to give a biased interpretation to the Security Council resolution, which would then cease to be an agreed documentary consensus available as a basis for the ultimate and inevitable negotiation. But what will it profit to gain an Assembly majority, but to lose Israel's adherence to a set of principles common to it and to neighboring States? The roads to peace do not have their starting point in war or in polemical debate. They branch out from one of the many avenues and by-ways of negotiation on which we shall meet Egypt when its choice is made and declared.
110.	This session could mark a recuperation in the career of ""the United Nations if the Organization made this the year of negotiation, the year of negotiation in all outstanding disputes. It has other tasks. The Second United Nations Development Decade can be saved from the frustrations of the First if the advanced countries turn aside from the perils of monetary war towards an expanding vocation in the development of emergent societies.
111.	And in the last resort this Organization will be judged according to the role it has played in defense of human welfare and dignity, The call of kinship and of dark memory will bring us to refer at appropriate stages in Committees and in the plenary meetings to two dramas of great intensity and pathos: the Jews of the Soviet Union, of whom some have reached us but of whom the great majority are still restrained from the expression of their cultural identity and their national hope; and the captive remnants of helpless Jews in Arab lands, especially in Syria, whose anguished voice cries out for liberation from terror and despair. This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit. It may be bearing within itself the seed of a universal order in which men will come together to save their environment from pollution, their society from disruption, their economy from decline, their life from the stress and grip of violence. There is no room for fatalistic despair. There is still time for men and nations to be, inspired by a new and spacious vision and to invest their thought and labour in defence of the ""common heritage of mankind"".



"
5,1999,"ISR_post_1998","The fifty-fourth session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations takes place
at a time marking humanity's crossing into the next
millennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain of
tumultuous events that have reshaped the map of the
family of nations.
12


The United Nations was born against the backdrop of
the destruction and desolation of the Second World War,
the most bitter, deadly and inhumane war known to
mankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths of
evil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization and
will be recalled in history as a nightmare in which man
created the devil, who wreaked devastation, destruction,
terror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken by
the Allied forces against the Nazi monster, and the creation
of the United Nations in April 1945, on the verge of the
defeat of the forces of destruction, was an act that marked
the return of humanity to its senses, to salvage the future of
mankind.
In this month when we mark 60 years since the
outbreak of the most horrible of wars, we are strengthened
more than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in the
necessity of the United Nations and of its activities
throughout the world. The various agencies of the United
Nations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; to
supply the needy with food and nourishment; to build
bridges between cultures; to promote education and
overcome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugees
and displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters,
whether natural or man-made.
The soldiers of the United Nations forces are the true
peacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from all
the nations of the world. At times they risk their lives in
areas riddled with conflict and violence around the world,
whether their United Nations mandate is to make peace or
to be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions,
important as they may be to the policy makers and shapers
of international relations, have no meaning to the individual
United Nations soldier, posted far from his country, who
brings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy,
suffering and violence.
After many centuries of violence and war, of
enslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderous
ideologies, after decades of cold war and polarized world
alliances of the East and the West, the human race is now
making great strides down the paths of peace and
reconciliation. Before our very eyes, a process is
enveloping the world, signalling hope for the future.
Mankind is adopting a new path, the path of the prophet
Isaiah, who as far back as 2,600 years ago prophesied that
the day would come when
“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)
This prophecy — which has been adopted by the
United Nations as a source of hope, as the symbol of the
victory of the good in human beings over evil — should
serve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for all
who cherish peace around the world and for their
representatives gathered here today.
The world has become more open. Satellites, the
Internet and telecommunications networks shorten
geographical and cultural distances. The political and
ideological blocs of the past have disintegrated, and the
walls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants and
dictators who built them. They are being replaced by new
blocs, some of which are in the process of being created
where development and prosperity reign. I hope and
believe that these beneficial transformations will also
occur in the Middle East.
In our region, too, the light of hope has been
rekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process,
the objective of which is to reach peace between States
and reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reach
a comprehensive peace with its neighbours, a peace of
harmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merely
political or strategic peace. In our eyes, the absence of
war is not the peace we aspire to achieve.
May I be allowed to emphasize once again that
peace means a culture of peace; peace means no more
threats of violence, whether implied or categorical; peace
entails the end of boycotts, the end of contempt and
defamation, the end of incitement and confrontation...
peace is also a language of peace: it is the way leaders
address their nations, teachers teach their students and
religious leaders inspire their followers.
At a time when various kinds of religious extremism
are rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom and
human freedom, it is essential that inter-faith dialogue be
strengthened and that the religions be manifested in their
enlightened forms, which sanctify tolerance and
coexistence.
On the way to achieving peace in our region, we
often find ourselves confronted with contradictory
realities. Parallel to the political process, our negotiating
partners are conducting a constant political war against
Israel in various international forums, including from the
podium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent
13


with the peace process and is intolerable, as are the extreme
decisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. These
decisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace, as
expressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
We hoped for and expected a different atmosphere,
one that would complement the impetus initiated by the
new Government in Israel. We have been saddened to
witness events that undermine the essence of peace. These
events can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.
Engaging in a peace process, on the one hand, and
maintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions, on the
other, raises some serious concerns about our negotiating
partners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace of
normalization with open borders, or is it only one of
temporary initial recognition? Will our relations with the
Gulf and Maghreb countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia,
Mauritania, Qatar and Oman, be allowed to expand and
develop? Or will these relations remain hostage to mood
swings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations or
whenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts about
these cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light of
the heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking upon
itself in this process.
Three weeks ago, on 4 September, Israel and the
Palestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum, which for the first time creates a direct,
chronological, political and conceptual link between the
Interim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13
September, the final status talks were renewed between
Israelis and Palestinians.
We are determined to reach a framework agreement
that will form the basis of the final status agreement by
February 2000, as stated and agreed upon in the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will select
the issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.
The topics at hand are known, as are the differing vantage
points and positions of each side. The differences can be
resolved only by direct negotiations.
Regarding the final status, I wish to affirm from this
podium that when we refer to political separation as one of
the prime concepts of the permanent settlement, we are also
saying that, for the benefit of both sides, we should not
necessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in the
various spheres of living.
From Israel’s perspective, there is no competition and
never has been any between the different negotiating tracks.
Israel also aspires to reach peace with Syria, our
neighbour to the north. This is, after all, in the higher
common interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r ,
along with these common interests, the following point
must be made clear: A democratic country like Israel
cannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks that
requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as
dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the
opposing side.
We must maintain the momentum of good will so
that we can face our children, Syrian and Israeli alike,
with a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:
We tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon the
leaders of Syria, in view of what we have gone through
together, to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetings
and discussion are not political sacrifices — they are
basic necessities.
On the road to a comprehensive peace, we wish to
see Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomaly
which has developed in its territory must come to an end.
We have never had nor do we have now any territorial
claims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and only
interest is to guarantee the safety and security of our
citizens. I must say that, regrettably, the Government of
Lebanon has for many years failed to enforce its
sovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarm
Hezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and that
Israel, within the framework of an agreement, will be able
to leave the southern part of Lebanon.
Nevertheless, with that as our ambition, I wish to
emphasize that we will not be held hostage much longer
on this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We will
make our own independent decisions, as we see fit, in
order to ensure our protection and our vital interests,
taking all options under consideration.
A reconciliation between Israel and its neighbours
must extend the promise that all the peoples of the region
may reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must not
be viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcome
of peaceful coexistence, normalization is not in the
service of one particular party. It is in the interests of all
the nations of the region.
We hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early as
this year. There is a need for close cooperation in
regional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendous
potential. In order to fully realize this potential, we must
establish a mechanism of true cooperation among the
14


States of the region. This cooperation would clearly be to
the benefit of all of us in the region.
The scarcity of water in our region, which will only
get worse, may impose a new way of life on the inhabitants
of the Middle East in the coming years. Israel is
anticipating this problem and preparing for it, but in this
case, as in others, cooperation in the region is essential and
will benefit all sides.
The working groups of the multilateral tracks
undertook various assignments of primary importance.
Unfortunately, their activities have been frozen for
irrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Any
delay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peace
process and delay the aid packages so essential to the
peoples of the region. Throughout this important process,
on the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike, we are
accompanied by the international community. First and
foremost was the United States of America, along with the
Russian Federation, the European Union, Canada, Norway,
Japan, China and other countries and organizations that
have assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributions
earn them special commendation from this rostrum.
Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking
down the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in our
region. Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as
renewing the multilateral tracks, are essential to furthering
the common objectives of the nations in our region. T h e
relations between Israel and Jordan are an example of
appropriate and favourable relations between neighbouring
countries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations
between the two nations in the economic, social and
political realms.
As we march further along the difficult path of
making peace, we look back with sorrow and sadness as we
remember the pioneers who broke new ground and are no
longer with us today: the late Menachem Begin, Anwar
Saddat, Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein and King Hassan II
of Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us to
continue to work towards completing their enterprise of
peacemaking.
We cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region is
neither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiate
the peace process, we remain aware of the threats and
dangers directed against us, threatening the stability of the
entire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism, on the
one hand, and of the potential use of weapons of mass
destruction, on the other, threatens the peace, stability and
future of the entire region. This threat is not just an
element of academic debates in the study of international
relations, but a harsh reality which we must all face.
From this international platform, I call for a halt to
all technological, scientific and other kinds of assistance
to countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons,
while threatening the existence of the State of Israel and
the region as a whole.
The Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadership
lacking reason and stability poses a threat to all the
countries in the region and to the world at large. The
monitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must be
immediately resumed. That is the obligation of the
international community so long as the Iraqi regime seeks
non-conventional weapons and threatens the region. The
United Nations is the largest, most authoritative and most
recognized international body. It should therefore be the
one to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbing
this danger.
Terrorism is an additional strategic enemy and we
cannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat not
only to Israel, but to many other nations across the world
as well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. There
can be no coexistence with terror, either in the context of
the negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours,
or in the broader regional context. Anyone who believes
that terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated is
mistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. A
synthesized, coordinated and unrelenting approach must
be adopted against it.
Here, in this building of stone and glass, reflecting
the current image of our world today with its points of
light and shadows of darkness, counterparts and enemies
meet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum for
discussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way to
resolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogue
and common language are the tools of diplomacy, the raw
material for the creation of a new reality and the
foundation for a stable and safer society.
It was here in the General Assembly, at the
beginning of the decade, that I first met with my Chinese
counterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation between
our two countries, we endeavoured to re-establish
diplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was also
here that we laid the groundwork for establishing ties
with the former Soviet Union, as well as with India,
Nigeria and other States. These are only a few examples
15


demonstrating the possibility in this arena for building a
bridge between nations and States.
As a nation that experienced great difficulties,
overcome only by accelerated development efforts, the State
of Israel takes part in the international effort to aid others
and share knowledge, experience and technology,
experience which it has accumulated in various fields. The
nation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharing
and identifying with the world at large.
Through the Division for International Cooperation
within the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel maintains ongoing
projects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. We
have demonstration units and we are conducting research.
For example, a special medical centre was recently
established in Mauritania and serves the many citizens of
that State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly,
Israel invests great efforts and resources in training
professionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary for
meeting the various challenges that engage many parts of
the world.
In the more than 40 years since its inception, the
Division for International Cooperation has trained more
than 70,000 trainees from more than 120 countries, who
have come to Israel and attended its training courses in the
areas of agriculture, water resources, health and medicine,
science, education and others.
In 1998 alone, some 155 courses were held in Israel
on a variety of topics, with the participation of more than
4,000 trainees. Gladly, I can report that many of the
trainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820
Palestinians participated in these courses over the past year,
thereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace which
have been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In the
same year, Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60
different countries, with the participation of over 7,000
trainees. I am proud to point out that in many of the
countries to which we sent Israeli experts, the local
personnel managed to translate our goodwill into positive
results on the ground, to the benefit of their people and
their land.
Because of the reputation it has acquired, the Division
for International Cooperation is also one of the central
addresses in Israel to which people can turn in times of
disaster around the world. We have recently witnessed just
how essential such assistance can be in times of natural
disasters. Israel has always responded favourably to
requests for aid and relief, regardless of the political
context or the state of diplomatic relations.
We wish to support and commend the United States
of America, our friend and ally, an inspiration to us all in
its efforts to promote the values of cooperation among
nations. This is also the time to express our appreciation
to the United States for its intensive efforts to bring true
peace to the Middle East.
Even today in the United States we have witnessed
again a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case at
hand is the threat to declare a boycott against the
American company Disney, because the company dared
to allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibition
celebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats and
the use by certain Arab States of this anachronistic
device. It has no place here or anywhere else in the
world.
Over thousands of years, since the time of biblical
King David, the builder of Jerusalem, until the present
day, Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any other
nation in the world besides the nation of Israel, the
Jewish people. Even after our forced exile from the land
of Israel, we continued, generation after generation, to
stay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem was
carried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.
In our wanderings, in the East and in the West, in
the African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia, from
the golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition,
during the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to the
charred ashes of the Holocaust, throughout all the above
the eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directed
toward Jerusalem. Year after year, from father to son, the
anthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been “Next
Year in Jerusalem”.
With the passing of those previous generations and
exiles, we have had the privilege of being deemed worthy
to return to Jerusalem, to rebuild the ruins, to rededicate
the city as a centre radiating with beauty, open to all
followers of all religions, as the poet has said, where
freedom of all religions is a fact of life.
It is so upsetting then that even today, 51 years since
the independence of the State of Israel, there are still
those who would deny our natural right to decide the
location of our capital, a natural right given to every
nation in the world. From Jerusalem, the city of David, I
will quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem,
16


in words which transcends the limits of time and retains
their meaning in every generation:
“Our feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmly
together.” (The Holy Bible, Psalm 122:2-3)
Today, as before, from this podium we declare to the
entire world, to our friends and people and those who are
distant from us: Jerusalem, unified under Israeli
sovereignty, is and will remain forever the capital of Israel.

"
5,1979,"ISR_prev_1998","161.	Mr, President, please accept my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide the work of the Assembly efficiently and fairly.
162.	I would also like to express our appreciation to the President of the last session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Lievano of Colombia.
163.	It is my pleasure to congratulate Saint Lucia on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
164.	As we reflect on the development of the United Nations throughout the past year, we find the spectacle far from encouraging. The fundamental obstacle to the Organization's work is the selectivity which has been forced upon it by an automatic majority of the membership, which is far from impartial and prefers expediency to principles. The United Nations specialized agencies have suffered badly from this. Organs like UNESCO, WHO, the ILO and others have been severely affected by heavy politicization which has influenced their functioning. Instead of dedicating themselves solely to their specific fields in the service of mankind, they have been reduced to forums of political one-sidedness.
165.	There must be a return to the United Nations Charter. Consultation and agreement should be restored to their primary place. In particular, the specialized agencies must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they have been dragged, so that they may devote themselves to the economic, social, humanitarian, scientific and technological tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform so well when permitted to do so.
166.	There has been little improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Even though the number of exit visas for Soviet Jews has increased recently, the gap between the number of Jews applying for exit visas and those granted them is growing, while an even larger number of Soviet Jews have been denied the fundamental right to emigrate—a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki Declaration. Those Jews who do insist on their rights are subjected to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment and, in some cases, to arrest and imprisonment. We have taken note of the fact that seven Jewish prisoners were released a few months ago. However, we are particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences imposed on other Jews whose only crime is their desire to re-join their families in Israel—Iosif Begun, Boris Kalendarov, Iosif Mendelevich, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Simon Shnirman, Vladimir Slepak, Aleksandr Vilic and Amner Zavurov. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and permit everyone who seeks to emigrate to Israel and join his people and his family to do so.
167.	We cannot be silent in the face of the rising incitement against the State of Israel and the Jewish people, its religion, culture and national movement, as manifested day by day in the official Soviet media. In this regard, it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their religion and culture. We appeal to the Soviet Union to allow Jewish religion and culture to be practised and expressed freely, and to put an end to anti-Jewish propaganda.
168.	We also deeply regret that the Government of Syria continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and to be reunited with their relatives living in other lands. We appeal to the Syrian Government to change this policy.
169.	The past year witnessed a historic break-through in the Middle East. In March, Israel and Egypt signed the first ever Israel-Arab peace treaty. President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel concluded that Treaty after intense negotiations, which lasted a year and a half and which demanded great leadership and courage. Israel wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States of America and to its President, Mr. Jimmy Carter, personally for the vital role which they played in bringing about this historic achievement, which has created a new reality in our region.
170.	Let me recall here that Israel has throughout the first 30 years of its independence constantly extended its hand to its neighbours in the search for peace. This found expression on the very first day of the establishment of our State, in the Israel Declaration of Independence of 14 May 1948. Let me add specifically that as early as in the summer of 1967, very shortly after the six-day war, Israel had taken the initiative and offered to sign a treaty of peace with Egypt, declaring its readiness to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egyptian sovereignty in the context of a peace treaty. This Israeli proposal was rejected, and the answer given by Egypt at the time was: ""No negotiation, no recognition and no peace with Israel: what was taken by force will be taken back by force."" This year, however, has seen the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. After a generation of continued warfare, the realization of a dream begins.
171.	The Treaty of Peace, which, as stated in its preamble, is ""an important step in the search for comprehensive peace in the area,"" has provided for a role in its implementation to be fulfilled by the United Nations. United Nations forces and observers were called upon to carry out functions in order to see that the peace treaty was fully implemented. Ironically and paradoxically, that initiative taken by some States Members of the United Nations in the cause of peace was rejected by the United Nations. The Security Council was exposed to the threat of a Soviet veto, and the mandate of UNEF was not renewed, so that the Security Council in effect disassociated itself from the first positive and major step in the great effort to relieve the Middle East from the dangers of war.
172.	Although our assumption and hope that the United Nations would assist in the implementation of the Treaty of Peace have been disappointed, we will proceed along the path of peace. The attitude of the United Nations will not damage the peace process; but it will, no doubt, lower the prestige and even the moral stature of the United Nations, one of whose basic principles and purposes is, as stated by the Charter, to ""maintain international peace and security . . . and to bring about by peaceful means . . . settlement of international disputes. . . ''.
173.	As a result of the Treaty of Peace, the process of normalization in the relations between Egypt and Israel has already begun. We are confident that in the months ahead we shall make further progress in cementing new bonds of co-operation.
174.	The frequent visits and meetings of the leaders of both countries are also an expression of the common desire to promote understanding and closer personal relationships. The most recent—and most impressive—visit of President El-Sadat to Israel three weeks ago and the reception given him in the city of Haifa, where Jews and Arabs coexist in harmony and cooperation, indicated the deep feelings of all the population of Israel towards the era of peace and, we hope, left warm memories in the minds and hearts of our Egyptian guests.
175.	Over the past year the situation in Lebanon has become grave. The intervention of Syria has, in fact, plunged the northern part of that formerly prosperous country into a state of anarchy, and the Lebanese Government has become incapable of ruling and exercising its authority over all of its territory. The southern part of Lebanon has been, to a great extent, in the hands of the terrorist groups of the PLO, whose murderous activities have been a source of danger and harassment not only to Israel, but also to the Christian and Moslem Lebanese in that area.
176.	UNIFIL was established by Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978.
177.	Israel, having been compelled to act militarily against the PLO in southern Lebanon in a clear act of self-defence, agreed to withdraw its forces, provided that the new United Nations force would undertake to restore peace and security in the area and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the country.
178.	Unfortunately, the aim of restoring Lebanon's integrity has not been achieved, and the Lebanese Government is still incapable of exercising its sovereignty. PLO terrorist groups are still functioning all over Lebanon and, in quite a large number of cases, inside the area of United Nations units. In this region, which was free from any terrorist presence at the time of the Israeli withdrawal, there are now about 700 PLO terrorists, who are acting murderously through the lines of the United Nations Force against the people of Israel. The Force was supposed to act against this. The Secretary-General, in his initial report of 19 March 1978 spoke of the right of self-defence of the Force, including resistance by forceful means to attempts to prevent it from discharging its duties.
179.	In his report of 13 September 1978, the Secretary-General stated, among the guidelines and terms of reference of UNIFIL, that ""uniformed or armed personnel and military equipment are not allowed to enter the UNIFIL area of operation""."" However, there are too many cases in which the Force has in fact reconciled itself to the presence and activities of the terrorists in its own area. UNIFIL has not carried out its mandate and duties in this respect, despite the fact that its units have themselves suffered from terrorist activities and at least eight UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in these incidents. The presence and activities of the PLO terrorist groups in the region are in violation of the UNIFIL mandate, and it should be understood that Israel cannot be expected to sit back while terror is being unleashed against its population, no matter where in Lebanon these actions originate.
180- Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries ceased to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. No cause can justify terrorism. The issue is, therefore, a fundamental one for the international community, and the struggle against terrorism should continue until terrorism has been brought to an end.
181.	The PLO, by its very nature and actions, is a terrorist organization. Its true character is reflected in its so-called' 'Covenant"", which calls for the purging of the Zionist presence from Palestine. The same document denies the existence of the Jewish people and its unbroken historical ties with the land of Israel. It alleges that the establishment of the State of Israel is null and void and rejects outright any plans to settle the Middle East conflict by peaceful means.
182.	The PLO has not hesitated to try to translate its vicious doctrine into criminal deeds. It has conducted an unceasing campaign of terror aimed at the mass murder of innocent civilians in Israel. From June 1967 to date, over 640 people have been murdered and 3,300 others have been wounded in Israel by the PLO. It has also terrorized and intimidated Arabs prepared to negotiate peace with Israel, killing more than 350 Arabs and injuring almost 2,000 others.
183.	Given the PLO's character and aims, it was, in fact, recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process. No country can or should be expected to negotiate with a party which denies its very existence, aims at its destruction, and uses terror against its civilian population. On the other hand, careful provision was made in the Camp David agreements to include Palestinian Arab residents of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District in the peace process.
184.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East, Agreed at Camp David by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel, and witnessed by the President of the United States of America, refers positively and constructively to Palestinian Arab rights, as well as to the rights and security interests of the other parties. It is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which are the only agreed basis for peace negotiations in the Middle East. Any tampering with them can only gravely jeopardize the current peace process.
185.	This Framework agreement sees the solution of the question of the Palestinian Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District in terms of granting them full autonomy, for a transitional period of five years, before reaching an agreement on the final status of the area. For that reason, it was agreed to negotiate on a principle of self-government—exercised through an administrative council—for the Arab inhabitants of the areas in question.
186.	Moreover, in the preamble to this Framework, the signatories invited other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere to it as well. In the letter sent by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel to President Carter on 26 March 1979—the date of the signing of the peace treaty—they invited the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Join the negotiations.
187.	This Framework provides for negotiations on the transitional period of five years, and also for the subsequent negotiations on a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, in which the location of the boundaries dividing the two countries will be agreed. The option of creating a third State between Israel and Jordan is, therefore, not considered in the Camp David agreements.
188.	Thus, the objective of the negotiations being held now, based on the Camp David Framework, is the provision of full autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. The Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants. This Framework also specifies measures that will be taken to assure the security of Israel and its neighbours.
189.	The only way to keep the process of peace going on is for us to adhere strictly to the Camp David agreements in their letter and spirit, and I should like to assure this Assembly that this is the policy of Israel.
190.	Before concluding, let me say a few words about Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people.
191.	Jerusalem has known many foreign rulers during the course of its long history, but none of them regarded it as their capital. Only the Jewish people has always maintained it as the sole centre of its national and spiritual life. For thousands of years, Jews have prayed daily for their return to Jerusalem and, for the past century and a half, Jerusalem has had a continuous and uninterrupted Jewish majority.
192.	Jerusalem cannot be divided again by barbed wire and there can be no return to the repeated shooting at our civilians and the barbaric desecration of the Jewish quarter of the City, the Holy Places and cemeteries, as happened before 1967, when the eastern part of Jerusalem was under the occupation of Jordan. It is relevant to recall that, in grave violation of the 1949 Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement; Jordan prevented Jews from having access to their Holy Places and cultural institutions and tried to eliminate systematically every trace of Jerusalem's Jewish past. By contrast, as a result of Israel's policy of free access to all Holy Places, millions of Moslem and Christian tourists and pilgrims—in addition to Jewish visitors—have come to Jerusalem since 1967, and have prayed and worshipped freely at its mosques and churches.
193.	Jerusalem is now a city of coexistence between Jews and Arabs. At the same time, the Government of Israel is and has always been conscious of the fact that Jerusalem is of deep concern also to other faiths, and that its religious and cultural sites are precious to Christians and Moslems, as well as to Jews. There should be completely free access to all the holy shrines by believers of all religions, without any exception, completely protected and guaranteed by the law of the country, and those holy shrines should be administered by the respective representatives of the religions concerned, without any interference.
194.	The choice before the United Nations is clear. This Organization, whose Charter enjoins it to support the cause of international peace and security, must not submit to the designs of those who reject peace. Let the United Nations give peace its full support. Let the Governments of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judaea, Samaria and Gaza join the negotiations in order to achieve the noble goal of a real and durable comprehensive peace in our area."
5,1980,"ISR_prev_1998","Mr. President, at the outset I should like to express to you our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and the outstanding qualities that you have exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy ensure your ability to keep a firm grasp on the helm of the Assembly during this stormy period.
53.	Al the opening of this session a new State joined the ranks of the United Nations: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I should like to welcome it to the Organization and wish it all prosperity and success as an independent and sovereign Stale.
54,	To my very grout regret, it is not possible to express satisfaction at the condition of the United Nations today, cither in general or from the specific perspective of my country. Indeed, it is questionable whether there remains much similarity or correlation between the noble ideals, principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the United Nations and the reality prevailing in the Organization today. The founders of this Organization saw in their vision a forum and a framework for the achievement and maintenance of peace between nations after the horrific experience of the Second World War, a horror which they had experienced at first hand.
55.	Perhaps the most cynical expression of the gap between the original vision and the reality prevailing in the United Nations today has been the refusal of this Organization, ostensibly dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to adopt and encourage the Camp David accords' and the subsequent Peace Treaty, which brought to an end decades of hostilities between Israel and Egypt and raised the possibility of expanding the peace process to embrace all of Israel's neighbours. This Organization, whose principal purpose is the promotion of peace among nations, has thus betrayed its own raison d'etre by rejecting an historic step towards peace and by playing into the hands of the enemies of peace, the rejectionists and the warmongers.
56. This unhappy phenomenon is not confined to the General Assembly. Out of the 18 debates which have been conducted thus far during 1980 in the Security Council, nine were devoted to subjects involving my country. Is there anyone who seriously believes that half of the world's international problems today are connected with Israel? We need only glance at a map of our region, the Middle East—which is just one region of the world—to sec that it is riddled from length to breadth with countless conflicts between States, between ethnic minorities and between different religious groups. Virtually all those conflicts have a history and a dynamic of their own, totally divorced from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
57. By way of illustration. I need only mention the situation in Afghanistan and. of course, the full-scale war between Iran and Iraq—a worrying outbreak of hostilities which has wide-ranging implications. That war between two States ruled by extremist, irresponsible and trigger-happy regimes threatens both regional and international security by putting at risk much of the world's regular supply of oil, That war, a struggle between two Moslem States, demolishes, in our opinion, the naive and groundless belief that the world's oil supply is dependent on a pro-Arab solution to the dispute between Israel and its neighbours. It has become all too clear that the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will not provide any miracle cure for the region as a whole or eliminate the many other grave conflicts raging in it. The ability of the United Nations to work for an end to the bloodshed in Iraq and Iran will be a yardstick of the Organization's ability to continue to fulfil its role for the encouragement and maintenance of peace.
58.	Important tasks have been allotted to the United Nations. Besides its role in the preservation of international peace and security, it also has a vital role to play in other spheres which require our earnest attention, in particular through the specialized agencies established for various purposes. But even the specialized agencies have been gravely compromised by the plague of politicization. Business-like debates and deliberations in them have become increasingly difficult—if not all but impossible to conduct—to the grave detriment not only of the agencies themselves but also of those whom they were set up to serve.
59.	While I am bound to express deep regret at the condition of the United Nations today. I must also express the hope that all Members of the Organization which share our concern and feelings of responsibility for its future will intensify their efforts both to bring the United Nations back to the ideals of its founders and to channel the specialized agencies back to their specific areas of concern.
60.	Among the subjects which have rightly been given a prominent place in the agenda of the United Nations are the state of the world's economy and the relations between the industrialized and the developing nations. The convening of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly attests to this fact. Israel took part in that special session with the intention of making a constructive contribution to its work. We therefore share the disappointment over the results of that event, which were not adequate. We sincerely hope that in the near future the efforts to have a constructive dialogue rather than confrontation will be resumed, so that those whose needs are greatest will not suffer the most.
61.	Despite our small size and limited resources, we have for decades devoted far greater efforts than might have been expected to assisting nations of the third world in the development of their economies and societies. Israel has shared freely the know-how which it has developed, as well as its experience as a small State in an arid and subtropical region, which has enabled us to make great strides over a period of a few short years.
62.	The problems encountered by Israel in the course of its social and economic development are similar to the problems facing much of the developing world today. Many of the solutions worked out in Israel can be applied directly by others. Despite the disappointments which my country has experienced, Israel continues to have deep sympathy for the struggle of the developing countries to ameliorate and advance the condition of their peoples and economies. Israel stands ready to continue to give of its know-how and to take a vigorous and constructive part in the efforts of the international community in the spheres of health, social services, agriculture, development of new and renewable sources of energy, and in every other sphere to which we can contribute.
63.	From this rostrum I should like to give expression to the anguish of our Jewish brothers in various parts of the globe. There is. it would seem, no end to the pain of the Jew in history. The suffering and persecution continue even today. And we, the people of Israel, feel responsible for the lot of every Jew who suffers anywhere.
64.	In the last year additional harsh limitations have been imposed on Jews who seek to leave the Soviet Union and emigrate to the State of Israel. Those restrictions conflict with the most basic human and national rights of peoples, and we are in duty bound to echo the cries of the Jews in the Soviet Union and appeal to the Government of that country to remove the restrictions and facilitate the immigration of Jews to Israel.
65.	We must also express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed, and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic-human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds as hostages and which it prevents from leaving.
66.	The Jews of Iran have suffered painfully in recent months, and their situation is deteriorating from day to day. Many Jews have been thrown in gaol; others have been given the death sentence, in most cases on ""charges"" of contact with Israel. We know of the difficulties in dealing with the present regime in Iran, to which fundamental concepts of human rights and the norms of international relations seem foreign. But we hope that sight will not be lost of the situation of the Jews there who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of the minorities in that troubled land.
67.	Two years ago a development took place in the Middle East—a breakthrough which can appropriately be called historic. After serious negotiations between the parties, with the active and important participation of the United States, the Camp David framework and the subsequent Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty were signed by the leaders of the two countries and witnessed by the President of the United States. Israel made major concessions and took considerable risks by signing those agreements, l.et me cite only our withdrawal from the oilfields in Sinai, for there is no need for me to waste words on the significance and implications of that step in this day and age. Similarly I need only point to the strategic depth in Sinai which Israel has relinquished, as well as to the advanced air bases located in Sinai, the evacuation of which will be implemented in due course in accordance with the terms of the Peace Treaty.
68.	Israel believed that its concessions and sacrifices would be met with appreciation and understanding by the world community and that a long-awaited breakthrough would be achieved on the international scene. Not only has that not 06itte about, but many countries in the world have spared no effort to destroy that hard-won peace, and Israel continues to be the object of unending accusations and attacks.
69.	Nevertheless, the decision and determination of Israel remain firm to continue on the road to peace. Thus, in accordance with the Camp David framework, negotiations have taken place for the attainment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea. Samaria and the Gaza District.
70.	Substantial progress has been achieved in these talks in certain fields, but the talks have, it is true, had their tips and downs and have even been suspended a number of times by Egypt. There is nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the difficulties encountered thus far in the progress of the talks. They reflect the complexities inherent in the subjects under discussion. The difficulties are familiar to any country which, at one time or another, has been engaged in complex negotiations involving multifaceted and long-standing problems.
71.	One area in which progress has been achieved in the negotiations is the modalities of the free elections to be held in the territories concerned. These procedures would make the proposed autonomy into one of the few—all too few— examples of free democratic process in the Middle East. Progress has also been achieved in the area of powers and responsibilities of the autonomy covering many aspects of the everyday life of the inhabitants of the territories in question.
72.	We certainly believe that autonomy can and must be established. All the parties to the Camp David framework are convinced that the process set out in that framework is the only one which is within the realm of the possible. All alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem at hand—ideas such as the holding of an international conference or the like—are devoid of real prospect or purpose. No one can really believe that the various elements in the Middle East which arc so much at odds with each other would attend a peace conference and achieve a positive outcome that would lead to a solution acceptable to all. Thus too the ideas entertained by the European Community, which do not take Israel's position into account, are only likely to encourage those who are opposed to peace.
73.	Those who genuinely seek peace should encourage the progress which has been achieved through the Camp David process. Let them also bear in mind and give due regard to the fact that, by proposing the idea of autonomy in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, Israel has taken on itself great risks for the sake of peace.
74.	We hope that the autonomy talks will be resumed in the near future. We also hope that the process of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt will be intensified and will serve as the best possible proof and a living symbol of the fact that peace can and must take the place of war. The full significance of these peaceful relations should be grasped for what they are—and for what they may lead to—as the very corner-stone for peace in the region.
75. The leaders of Israel and Egypt have reiterated time and again their mutual commitment to the proposition that there will be no more war. Let us hope that the change which has come about in the Middle East with the signing of peace will be the opening for a positive and long-lasting transformation in the history of our conflict-ridden area. The strict adherence to the agreements by Israel, in accordance with their letter and spirit alike, is a guarantee of the continuation of the peace process. However, by itself it is not enough. We hope that all the others involved will act in the same way.
76. Much has been alleged against Israel in the name of the principle of self-determination for nations. We favour that concept, and we have proved that in the support that we extended to many States which have achieved their independence in our generation, in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. The Governments of those States and their peoples know that full well. But there is no connection between that principle and the perverted attempt to turn self-determination into the basis for the destruction of the Stale of Israel, as certain States are endeavouring to do. Anyone who is familiar with the ideology and the terminology of the murder organization that calls itself the PLO, as well as with the declarations of the various Arab rejectionist States, can see beyond all doubt that the term ""self-determination"", as they use it, is nothing more than a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.
77.	It should not be forgotten that the Palestinian Arabs have achieved their self-determination in Jordan, a State which is the Arab State in Palestine, by virtue of its history, territory, population, culture and all aspects of its national life. The establishment of a second Palestinian Arab Slate by distorting the principle of self-determination means the creation of an extremist and hostile base opposed to the very-existence of Israel. Hence we will not agree to a distorted form of self-determination, which in reality implies self-destruction for our ancient nation deeply rooted in its own land.
78.	The programme of autonomy which we have proposed for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, as accepted in principle in the Camp David frameworks, is the first practical proposal to be advanced to provide a dignified solution for the needs of the Arab population of those areas. It comes in place of all the empty declarations with which the Palestinian Arabs concerned have deluded themselves and have been deluded by other States and organizations over the years.
79.	One of the most vivid expressions of the rejection of all peace proposals by the Arab rejectionist States is to be seen in their unprecedented military build-up and in the armaments which they have received in recent years from the Soviet bloc or purchased from the United States and Western Europe. In the course of the last three years, orders for arms purchases by the larger Arab States have reached astronomic sums. The quantities of arms that were actually supplied have been equally staggering. There is no precedent for the amassing of arms on this scale in our region. Those arms are designated first and foremost for use against Israel. But the implications of that vast array of armaments ait not confined to my country alone. It also serves to inject war into the area at large.
80.	We call upon the United Nations to take due note of the military build-up by the Arab rejectionist States and to urge them to decrease their armament. For our part, we are prepared to lend a hand in any joint effort to bring about the limitation of arms in our region which is poised on top of a volcano.
81. I should like to address myself to another crucial aspect of disarmament. Israel has consistently supported resolutions of the General Assembly aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This global problem, we believe, can best be solved by means of negotiated regional arrangements. Hence, since 1975, Israel has consistently advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East on the Tlatelolco model. Israel believes that an international conference of all the Slates in the region and adjacent to our region should be held, leading to the conclusion of a formal, contractual, multilateral convention among all States of the region.
82.	We hope that in the course of this General Assembly, we shall find a suitable opportunity to give concrete expression to our views on this matter. In the meantime, I should like to reiterate my Government's position, which is that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israeli dispute.
83.	In the last months, Jerusalem has been the object of attacks on Israel in various international forums. There has been much hypocrisy and cynicism in those attacks, For, truth to tell, never has the situation of the various religions represented in Jerusalem been better than that prevailing since the unification of the city by Israel in 1967. For 19 years, between 1948 and 1967, the eastern part of the city was under Jordanian occupation and barbed wire divided it in two. Places holy to the Jews were maliciously desecrated. Ancient synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed in a barbaric manner, and Jews were denied access to the Holy Places which are the spiritual life-blood of the Jewish people. It is not out of place to remark that the Moslem Arab citizens of Israel were also denied access to their Holy Places during that ignoble period. And where, I am bound to ask, was the voice of this Organization during that period"".' Not once was it raised in condemnation of those illegal acts.
84.	On the other hand, since 1967. all—irrespective of religion and nationality—have been accorded free access to the city of Jerusalem and the possibility of worshipping at the Holy Places and shrines revered by them. Israel has assured the free and unfettered observance of the religious rites of all members of all faiths, who also administer their religious lives and their Holy Places without any outside interference. That is the truth well known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to everyone who has visited the city. There is no substance or basis to any claim to the contrary.
85.	There is no need for me to dwell at length on the bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem. The Jewish people is the only people which has made Jerusalem its capital since it appeared as a nation on the stage of human history. Throughout the many years of exile inflicted on it. The Jewish people prayed three times a day, every day, for its restoration to Jerusalem.
86. For the last 150 years there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Whoever seeks to sever Jerusalem from Israel seeks to decapitate the Jewish people. We hope that nations that seek peace and know the reality which prevails in Jerusalem today will respect the city as the sovereign capital of Israel; a city which will not be divided again, in the same way as Israel respects the Holy Places of all religions and their freedoms in the city.
87.	I wish to conclude with a call in the spirit of the Prophets of Israel, who were a light and an inspiration for much of mankind. My call is for peace—peace which is at the very basis of the existence of the United Nations.
88.	We in Israel yearn for peace. We have done so since the first day of the restoration of our national sovereignty—in our Declaration of Independence, which was issued on the very day that the State of Israel was founded in 1948. In that Declaration, we extend the hand of peace and good neighbourliness to all the States around us and all their peoples. We have taken far-reaching steps and have made huge sacrifices for the sake of peace. But peace with Israel does not mean peace without Israel, or peace at its expense. Nor does it mean peace with a weak Israel deprived of its capital and with its wings clipped from the security and geostrategic viewpoints. With such an Israel peace will not be attained, because a weak Israel will be an object of unceasing attacks and destructive designs.
89.	I wish to call upon the Arab States which are our neighbours, and also upon the Palestinian Arabs living in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, to follow the dictates of reason and to join the peace process. I wish to call upon the other nations of the world to support this course and to prevail upon the Arab States to adopt it. The world at large, and not merely our region alone, will benefit from this.
"
5,1986,"ISR_prev_1998","This session of the Assembly opens the fifth decade of the United Nations. I hope that it will begin an era in which this body will come closer to realizing the dreams of its founding fathers.
Their ideals were inspired and inspiring: safeguarding the principles of universality and equality, a genuine desire to maintain international peace and security, encouraging international cooperation in solving global problems and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Unfortunately, those lofty principles have been vitiated and perverted beyond recognition. Extremists have seized this body. They have compelled it to shun the only peace treaty in the Middle East - the Camp David Accords. They have forced upon it an annual ritual of adopting dozens of distorted and irrelevant resolutions relating to my country. In clinging to these barren exercises, the United Nations spends precious time and funds, resources that could profitably be used to combat
hunger and poverty.
These and other issues remain unresolved, however, and they demand serious and responsible attention. First among them is the repugnant reign of apartheid in South Africa.
Israel, founded upon basic moral and democratic values, cannot remain silent in the face of racial discrimination, wherever it nay occur.. We reject and condemn apartheid as a political, social and economic system. Israel also believes that violence is not the path to reform in South Africa. We must urgently foster a climate that will facilitate a political settlement if we are to avoid a further drift towards economic chaos, suffering and bloodshed. We hope responsible leaders on all sides will act to create such a climate and that the Government of South Africa will initiate negotiations that will satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of all South Africans, regardless of race or color.

In the heart of the African continent many continue to suffer from hunger, disease and poverty. There is a growing awareness around the world of the need to provide help. People must be fed right now. We have contributed to that effort, but we also believe that we must help countries afflicted by hunger to develop the long-term means to prevent its recurrence and to set their economies on the road to development and growth.
This past year the General Assembly convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The Organization of African unity (OAU) has outlined a development strategy that is reminiscent of Israel's own development experience. Israel announced at that special session its readiness to make immediate contributions to the attainment of those goals. We offered to share our experience in agriculture and desertification, in medicine and education and in the general field of economic development. Many in Africa remember our earlier contributions in this field. Our experience has been gained in 28 years of assistance by Israel to more than 100 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We have trained over 55,000 professionals from developing countries. We have shared our experience with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. And we are ready and willing to do more.
Many of those African States that severed relations with Israel in 1973 and 1974 are now in the process of resuming those relations. I wish to commend the leadership and courage of the Heads of State who have gone on to re-establish formal diplomatic ties with us despite the pressures exerted upon them. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all African nations and we expect many more countries to resume full diplomatic relations with Israel in the near future.
The Middle East, with its vast resources of land and minerals, has within it the potential to leap into a new age in the twenty-first century - an age of great economic prosperity and a better life for millions. But that hope hangs on the outcome of a precarious contest between those who seek progress and those who continually plunge the region into turmoil and hatred.
Perhaps the most tragic instance of the fanaticism that plagues our region is the cruel war waged by Iran and Iraq for the past six years. That war has claimed well over a million casualties; it has reintroduced outlawed means of warfare such as gas and chemical weapons and the wholesale torture of prisoners; it has hurt the entire world by threatening freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil. It is a sad commentary that, despite their various proclamations, those two warring Governments show no intention whatsoever of genuinely seeking ways to stop the horrible carnage.
Another instance of the reign of fanaticism and its terrible human cost is Lebanon. The tragedy is rooted in the chronic absence of an effective Government able to control and reconcile the warring factions. Without such a strong central authority, Lebanon has been unable to discharge the most elementary obligations of government - the control of one's territory against lawlessness and terror, terror directed against one's own citizens and against the citizens of neighboring States.
The first to pay for that anarchy have been the Lebanese themselves. Over 100,000 were slaughtered in the civil war of 1975-1976 and thousands of others have been killed since in sectarian clashes. Lebanon's Government has set no effective jurisdiction over any part of the country: not over the Bekaa Valley or Tripoli, where 20,000 Syrian troops physically occupy Lebanese territory; not over the Shouf Mountains; not even over Beirut itself. Such conditions encourage the reign of the gun, the rocket and the bomb throughout Lebanon. Naturally, the southern part of the country has not been exempt from that dismal pattern. Beginning with the PLO, various terrorist groups have used the south as a staging area for terrorist attacks against Israel. Those who expected that a ""Pax Syriana"" would pacify Lebanon were hopelessly deluded,.for Syrian domination of Lebanon has meant that Syria has been playing off one factor against another, as well as using Lebanon as a base for proxy terror attacks against Israel
and against targets world-wide.
That Syrian strategy, now shared by Iran, should concern the entire international community. As for Israel, we have one, and only one, objective regarding Lebanon: to protect northern Israel against attacks launched from Lebanon. This is self-defense in its simplest form. We shall not let Israeli citizens pay with their lives for Lebanon's failure to control its territory. We shall continue to take the necessary measures to defend our people. We hope that Lebanon will produce an effective Government with which we can agree on permanent security arrangements. In the meantime we shall continue to work with any Lebanese party genuinely interested in preventing terror in the South of Lebanon and in the North of Israel.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has tried to assist in bringing stability to the area. It has performed a useful role. It has suffered painful casualties in the process, including losses sustained in a recent rash of murderous attacks. We extend ou£r deepest condolences to the bereaved families end their Governments. We must be clear, however, on what role UNIFIL can and cannot play. International forces are most effective when they serve as buffers between two States that share a commitment to pacifying their common border. Unlike Israel's neighbors on two other borders, that is not the case with Lebanon. That is why UNIFIL, unlike the multinational Force in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, has been unable to act as an effective buffer, since the day it was established by the United Nations. Peace-keepers cannot be asked to combat terrorists. That role must be left to the Governments and the peoples in the area of turmoil. We shall continue to co-operate with UNIFIL, as we maintain the necessary security arrangements to defend our norther border.
Israel watches with concern the larger conflicts waged in our region: those between radicals and non-radicals, between conservative regimes and revolutionaries, among militant religious movements, and among the various dictatorships themselves. But there is little we can do to affect this tragic and chronic violence. Where we can act - where we have acted and shall continue to act - is in the limited confines of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.
Ever since Israel's independence we have made every effort to achieve peace with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our heritage. The Jewish people is a democratic and free people striving to rebuild its national life in the ancient - the only - homeland of the Jews. Israel is a haven for the persecuted, a land where ever Jew from whatever background feels at home. We can best achieve our ideals and goals in an atmosphere of peace and security. Hence, we cherish peace? we pray for it and we teach its blessings to our children. Our entire people rejoiced when, after decades of war which were forced upon us, we were able to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
During the past year we have made special efforts to broaden that peace. In July, Prime Minister Peres visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. We have made efforts to reinforce the peace treaty with Egypt and to solve the problems that are still outstanding. We hope we are on the threshold of a substantial improvement in the relations between our two countries. Such an improvement is vital in and of itself, and of even greater importance for the prospects for peace
with other Arab States.
A few days ago we marked the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. With the passage of time we can see that those accords were a turning-point in the history of the Middle East. They have proved decisively that there is a way out of the cycle of belligerency, and they have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no alternative to direct negotiations. To this very day they remain the one and only blueprint for accommodation and peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. All attempts to bypass, nullify or denigrate the Camp David accords have failed. Those attempts have been unsuccessful because they have disregarded the minimal needs of all parties, because they were not rooted in achievable proposals acceptable to all the sides.
Camp David accords are still the leading parties to which everyone concerned with peace in the Middle East turns. Together they hold the key to progress towards peace. With its commitment to the accords, Egypt has gained in prestige and stature. Many of those in the Arab world who once attacked and boycotted it are now looking to Egypt to play a leading role in peace negotiations. The United States, of course, is equally sought after. Many have come to appreciate the positive influence it brings to bear on the political process in our region.
For its part, Israel remains anxious and willing to move the peace process forward without delay. The peace treaty with Egypt was intended to be the first in a series of treaties that together would constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.
Those who are afraid of peace or who are seeking to evade peace with Israel are trying to promote an alternative to direct negotiations, and ultimately to peace itself, through an international conference. Let me repeat again: Experience proves that the only path to peace is through direct negotiations. Substitutes for such negotiations can only lead us away from peace. The history of our region provides anple evidence of this simple truth.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly called upon King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct peace negotiations with Israel. We recognize that once he decides to respond to our call Jordan may face considerable opposition from some Arab quarters. That opposition, however, will not be deflected or appeased by such devices as an international conference. Ultimately, Jordan will have to decide whether the advantages of peace with Israel outweigh the risks and difficulties involved in making such a move. But Jordan must understand that its peace will have to be with Israel, not with an international body. The first sign of a
genuine willingness to move towards peace is a declared readiness to deal directly with one's former adversary. There is no other way to a genuine reconciliation.
We firmly believe that the absence of democracy and freedom in our region is a major obstacle to peace. Only democracy offers the guarantee of freedom, the hope of progress and the prospect of peace. We do not believe any people want war. We do not believe the Arab peoples want war. Wars of aggression are initiated by Governments that do not represent the will of their peoples and fail to reflect their aspirations. That is why we must hope that democratic Governments will prevail throughout the Middle East on a not too distant day, for on that day true and permanent peace will come to our region. To hasten the coming of that day we call on all countries interested in peace in the Middle East strongly to support direct talks between Jordan and Israel. We call on them strongly to signify their willingness to buttress and strengthen a peace settlement by declaring their readiness to endorse it immediately. In addition, the supporters of peace should undertake to extend whatever assistance and support may be needed by the Government and the people of Jordan to embark on an ambitious development Program that will accompany the implementation of the peace treaty. The rewards of peace must be swift and exemplary, and serve to belie the words of its opponents.
Our region - the entire world in fact - is plagued by the spread of Arab terrorism. There is no limit to its atrocities. Even places of worship are not immune to this wanton murder. The recent attack on a synagogue in Istanbul was merely the latest and deadliest in a series of such attacks on Jewish places of worship. But Jews are not the only victims. Arab terror has made a blood pact with terrorists from all over the world to fight the common enemy, of which Israel and Jews are merely a part. That enemy is the community of democratic nations. The fight against this menace is therefore the fight of all civilized and free nations.
The so-called PLO was the linchpin of this alliance in terror; it pioneered the art of hijacking, bombing, kidnapping and massacre on an international scale. In the decade preceding 1982 the PLO used its mini-State in Lebanon to train and arm terrorist groups from five continents, from left-wing extremists to neo-Nazi gangs. Libya, Syria and Iran joined in financing, training and arming the terrorists and providing them with safe havens.
Since our action in Lebanon in 1982, the PLO has disintegrated into a number of rival terrorist gangs, most of them mercenaries in the service of various Governments. Their one common objective is to sabotage any attempt at peace and stability. The legacy of terror that they have created has encouraged other terrorist groups, many of them possessed by a mad desire to spread anarchy and terror for no reason whatsoever.
Much has been said about ways to combat international terrorism, but little has been done. Terrorism will continue to take its toll as long as the terrorists believe they can kill with impunity and achieve legitimacy and their political goals in the process. They must be denied these victories. They must never be appeased. They must never be ""understood"". They must always be condemned and fought vigorously. If we are serious in our desire to rid ourselves of international terrorism, we must adopt a broad and comprehensive campaign against the terrorists.
We must expel the representatives of terrorist organizations, starting with the PLO, from all countries committed to the fight against terror. We should hunt down the terrorist killers. They must always be on the run. But no matter what measures we take against the killers themselves, they will not be enough. If we do not go to the source, to the regimes whose support and protection make terrorism possible, we will not succeed in rolling back the tide of terror. We must isolate
and punish those terrorist States. We should shut down their embassies, expel their diplomats, curtail trade with them, and co-ordinate a military response if they persist in attacking us. Those who refuse to address the problem of State-supported terrorism are not merely failing to solve the problem? they are
facilitating its expansion.
Last year, from this rostrum, I spoke of three major threats facing the countries of the Middle East: the escalating race in conventional arms, the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the grave problem of chemical warfare. Unfortunately, little if anything has been done to reduce those threats. In fact, in some ways the situation has worsened in the past year.
The most dramatic development has been the increased use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran. This has been investigated by the united Nations and condemned by the President of the Security Council on behalf of its members. There is also considerable evidence that other States in the Middle East, most notably Syria, are developing a chemical warfare capability. The free world should pool information on this subject and adopt concerted measures to prevent the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons. We cannot afford to cower before dictatorships that stockpile these inhuman inventories, especially since these regimes have shown no hesitation in using them.
To our disappointment, negotiations on a nuclear-weapon-free zone among the States in the region have yet to begin. It is our firm belief that, in an area as sensitive as the Middle East, the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation would be a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries were among those which supported the establishment of our State in 1948. But things have changed. With the exception of Romania, all the Eastern-bloc countries have severed their diplomatic ties with us and adopted a one-sided policy towards the Middle East. We welcome, of course, any sincere attempt at improving relations and re-establishing diplomatic ties between us and any Eastern European country.
This year, for the first time in nearly 20 years, an official meeting took place in Helsinki between representatives of Israel and the Soviet Union. We hope that it is a sign of a positive change in the policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel. Without such a renewal of diplomatic relations and without a major change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Soviet Jews - especially the policy that prevents them from exercising their basic right of repatriation to Israel - it is difficult to see how the Soviet Union could contribute in any way to the attainment of peace in our region.
The plight of our Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union has been raised countless times by Israel's representatives and by world leaders; yet the tragic suffering continues. The hope that a new leadership in the Soviet Union would bring with it an improvement in the situation of Soviet Jewry has, so far, not been borne out. The condition of Soviet Jews, especially those among them wishing to leave for Israel, has deteriorated still further.
In a country of over 100 nationalities, speaking over 100 languages, Jews remain the only officially recognized nationality in the Soviet Union denied the right to maintain its cultural heritage and pass it on to the next generation. They are forbidden to study their ancient language, Hebrew. Throughout the entire length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not a single Jewish school where Jews may study their history, literature and traditions.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Soviet Union have expressed their desire to join their people in Israel. But the Soviet authorities have effectively stopped Jewish emigration; less than 500 Jews were allowed to leave during the first eight months of this year. Thousands have had their requests for exit permits repeatedly refused on the flimsiest of pretexts; as punishment for daring to apply to leave, they have been subjected to all manner of harassment and reprisals. Among those ""refuseniks"" are the prisoners-of-Zion, who have been subjected to arrests and lengthy terms of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. The real reason for their imprisonment is painfully clear: it is their insistence on their right to emigrate to Israel and their right to study Hebrew and persevere in their Jewish heritage.
The Soviet policy towards Soviet Jews is a flagrant violation of the International Convention on Human Rights, to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. It is totally contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Accords. The refusal of the Soviet Government to fulfill its most elementary humanitarian obligations must weigh heavily in the considerations of all who would contemplate entering into agreements with the Soviet Union on any subject.
Prom this rostrum, I call upon Governments and people of good will everywhere to urge the Soviet Government to bring its behavior towards Soviet Jews into line with universally accepted international standards. We in Israel will not rest until every Jew in the Soviet Union is permitted to exercise his right to emigrate and until Jews are free to follow their ancestral traditions and faith.
Another beleaguered Jewish community are the Jews of Syria. They are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies. They are not free to live wherever they wish. Several hundred young Jewish women cannot
find husbands in the Jewish community. The Syrian Government has callously refused to allow then to leave the country so that they may marry within their faith and establish families. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return. All that, too, is another instance of flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Syria is a signatory.
None of the problems I have described, including those relating to our region, is insoluble. They can be resolved if the Governments involved muster genuine good will, we turn again to the leaders of our Arab neighbors with an outstretched hand of peace. Let us bring an end to belligerency and hatred. Let us make real the hopes for a new era of understanding and coexistence. We shall not spare any effort in this quest, nor will we give up hope that it will bear fruit.
The eyes and hearts of millions of human beings who are wasting away from hunger and poverty, who live under oppressive regimes that deny them basic human rights, who are victims of barbaric terror, are turned towards us in the hope that we can alleviate their suffering. They look to us, to this body, for the hope of a better future. We cannot let them down and still claim fidelity to the ideals of this Organization. We bear the responsibility to begin action now for their sakes and for the sake of our place in history. Let us not forsake them, or our aspirations for a better and safer world."
5,1984,"ISR_prev_1998","It gives me pleasure, Mr. President, to associate myself with the warm congratulations offered to you from this rostrum. They are a tribute to your country and to yourself, as well as to a continent which is playing such a prominent role in the United Nations. I hope and trust that, under your leadership and guidance, the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be constructive, positive and responsive to the grave problems that face us.
101.	It is gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year, reinforced with new partners in our common endeavours. The United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality. The only attitude we should disavow is the promotion of narrow, selfish interests which run counter to our common international efforts.
102.	Every session of the General Assembly must set out in a spirit of hope that, despite the disappointments of the past, we can and should renew our efforts and work for a better world. Forty years ago, the founders of the United Nations looked back on a tragic past and undertook to forge instruments that would ensure a better future for humanity. So do we, in accordance with ancient Jewish tradition, look back year after year upon the disappointments of the past with firm belief in a better future, buoyed by an unflagging hope in the triumph of that human spirit which never deserts us.
103.	The fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War will occur in 1985, as has already been noted from this rostrum. This was a landmark in history and even more so in the annals of my people. Israel and the Jewish people, who still carry so many scars of that terrible war, will commemorate the occasion appropriately. The event will undoubtedly be marked by all nations, as was indeed recommended by the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which invited States Members ""to adopt . . . measures declaring punishable by law any dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . . including Nazi, Fascist and neo- Fascist ideologies"". The Assembly also appealed to all States to accede to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. There are still a few pockets of neo-Nazism that continue to linger, and they should be dealt with firmly, but the true heirs to this inhuman creed are those organizations and Governments that continue to this day to deny the right of existence of another State and strive for its outright destruction. There should be no room in civilized society for such doctrines or for those who promote them.
104.	The United Nations concept embraces the whole of mankind. Its raison d'etre is the welfare, present and future, of humanity, with special attention accorded to the underprivileged, the disabled and the oppressed. Our special attention should be focused on the problems of children and of youth and on their appropriate education and training. This should be our central task in building up our nations and societies.
105.	The coming year will be marked by the conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women, with the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the Decade to be held at Nairobi. Our hope is that that Conference will become a high point in women's struggle for equality and will not be exploited for narrow and barren political interests.
106.	Technological progress holds the promise of providing solutions to some of the most pressing problems of developing nations, but nowhere is it more sorely needed than in the field of agriculture and food production. It is now widely recognized that the international development effort has failed to meet its most important challenge, the production of food for the fast-growing population of our world. Agriculture is the key to the present challenge, but its development and that of the rural society that sustains it have been sadly neglected.
107.	Great strides have been made world-wide in industry, in the development of infrastructure, transportation, education and health, but food production has remained deficient. It is a terribly sad comment on our society that in this modern age millions go hungry and die of famine; hundreds of millions, mainly children, suffer malnutrition, their future as productive members of their society endangered. Per capita food production in Africa, for instance, has in fact dropped 15 per cent in the last decade. Countries in other continents have required emergency food supplies. Nations that were once self-sufficient have become importers of food and, as a result of their economic difficulties stemming from the increase in the cost of energy, their true independence has become endangered.
108.	Catastrophe awaits many nations if we do not find the way to assure adequate food for our world's growing population. World security and stability begin with the assurance of basic human needs. A change of direction is thus urgently needed in the goals of international development. That is the challenge of this decade. This goal can be reached despite the scarcity of arable land and water and despite the meagre resources that are available in various countries. In fact, Israel has emerged in only one generation from severe austerity and food rationing to self-reliance; we have increased our food production twelvefold and have become a net exporter of food.
109.	Israel recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its programme for international development co-operation. This programme had its beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the emergence of newly independent nations that sought rapid development. Imbued with a pioneering spirit that thrived on successful adaptation and innovation in the development of their own country, the people of Israel considered it a duty to share the knowledge acquired through their own rapid development experience with the peoples of other emerging nations.
110.	Israel calls upon all Governments to set aside political differences and narrow economic interests to join forces in the campaign against hunger. Israel will continue to co-operate with other nations in technology and development and stands ready to join other Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in working to meet this great challenge to humanity.
111.	Israel is the fulfilment of an age-old dream and prayer for the re-establishment of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel. It is the home of all Jews who wish to make it their home, and it is the defender and protector of all Jews who are oppressed or persecuted because they belong to the Jewish people. These principles are enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence, in its laws and in the conscience of its people.
112.	We are aghast at the fact that, 40 years after the eradication of Nazism, rampant anti-Semitism and racial discrimination still exist in a number of countries. The situation of Soviet Jewry has recently taken a definite turn for the worse. From this rostrum I call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to remove the harsh limitations and restrictions imposed upon Jews who seek repatriation and reunion with their brethren in Israel. The continued harassment of Soviet Jews has become one of the most pressing humanitarian problems of the day, a violation of the most basic human rights as expressed in the Helsinki accords. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are being systematically denied their rights and many are forced to live as outcasts, deprived of their livelihood, harassed or imprisoned in gaols and labour camps under inhuman conditions.
113.	Soviet Jews are deprived of access to Jewish culture. A systematic campaign is waged against those Soviet Jews teaching and studying the Hebrew language. Ill-concealed under the cloak of anti-zionism, officially inspired anti-Semitism is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media.
114.	We call upon the Soviet Government to change its policy, which is unjustifiable. The Soviet Jews are not involved in any anti-Soviet activity, nor are they violating Soviet laws or working against Soviet interests. Their only wish is to study their ancient culture and their national language and to live as Jews in their historic homeland. It should be recalled that in front of this very Assembly official representatives of the Soviet Union have declared that the Jewish people have a right to a State of their own. Soviet Jewry demands nothing more than to exercise this right.
115.	In our own part of the world, the Middle East, the Jews of Syria continue to suffer under a harsh regime that holds them hostage and refuses to grant them basic human rights, the most important of which is the right to emigrate and join their brethren. Periodic killings of Jews, either sanctioned or tolerated by the authorities, maintain a climate of terror among the Jews of Syria.
116.	In Ethiopia, an ancient Jewish community struggles to maintain its heritage, culture and integrity under dire hardship. We acknowledge the gesture of the Ethiopian Government, which has recently enabled Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to visit that community, and we express our sincere hope that it will take all necessary steps to protect and respect their religious and cultural rights and enable those who so desire to be reunited with their families in their ancient homeland.
117.	On 13 September 1984, a Government of national unity, encompassing the overwhelming majority of political parties in Israel, was established. Its creation is a reflection of the wide consensus that unites the people of Israel on the main issues on the Government's agenda in the economic, defence and political domains.
118.	In its foreign relations, Israel is dedicated, as always, to the goal of peace and accommodation with all its neighbours. In the north, we stand ready to reach an understanding with Lebanon which will guarantee the security of our common border and thus make possible the withdrawal of all forces from southern Lebanon. Syria remains dogmatically opposed to the idea of peace with Israel. Nevertheless, we are adamant in our conviction that there can be no solution other than peace. In the east, we have repeatedly called on the Government of Jordan to join us in negotiations for peace. In the south, of course, we have peace with Egypt, but we are convinced that peaceful relations should be deepened and strengthened in the face of so much rejectionist pressure against peace.
119.	The chances of progress towards further peace and stability between Israel and its neighbours must be appraised, however, in the context of the realities of the region.
120.	The Middle East continues to be beset by violence, bitter conflicts and wars. In a few weeks of bloodshed along the Iran-Iraq border, more men and children die than in all the Arab-Israel wars. Thousands die every year in domestic strife and hostilities entirely unconnected with the Arab-Israel conflict. Yet, as everyone in this Hall knows full well, a disproportionate amount of the time of the General Assembly is devoted year after year to a contrived and counter-productive review of the Arab-Israel conflict, the main purpose of which seems to be only to slander Israel.
121.	In the last two decades, the violence and oppression that characterize so many regimes in the Middle East have erupted on the international scene in waves of terrorism, hijacking and assassination. When in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed that the United Nations promote measures to counter international terrorism, we were among the first to welcome that initiative. Regrettably, it has been thwarted by States that sponsor and support terrorism. Middle Eastern terrorism, sanctioned by these Governments, has been thus allowed, through neglect and indifference, to expand to more and more countries. Today the cancer of terrorism has spread to all continents. The latest form of terrorism and international piracy is the mines that threaten shipping and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Recently, we were again horrified by the murderous bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a calculated and deliberate act of terrorism.
122.	Terror is a malignant disease that will spread everywhere if not contained. But at least in one instance concerted international effort has produced results. When terrorism first raised its ugly head in the mid-1960s, its prime target was international civil aviation. Planes were hijacked almost daily, aircraft bombed, passengers terrorized and murdered. The proper functioning of civil aviation today is a result of powerful measures taken jointly by many nations to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft and to combat the threat of hijackings. But such successful international co-operation remains an exception. Terrorism is still an item on the Assembly's agenda, but it is debated ineffectively, shunted aside by vested interests which offer its representatives support, sustenance and even quasi- recognition. As long as the family of nations continues to evade its responsibilities, to appease rather than punish, to pardon terrorists rather than prosecute or extradite them, to afford terrorists diplomatic immunity, the disease will spread and claim yet more victims in our homes and communities.
123.	Whenever a particularly outrageous terrorist attack takes place, as for example the recent bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a wave of outrage sweeps public opinion in all parts of the civilized world. People naturally demand instant retaliation against such despicable acts and a fitting punishment for the criminal perpetrators.
124.	While punishment has its necessary place in any system of justice, the overriding problem here is not whom to punish and how punishment should be delivered. Rather, it is how to prevent terrorism and root it out from the international arena. There is only one way to deal with this problem. Those countries which agree that terrorism must be eradicated should join forces and wage a permanent war on the terrorist organizations. This is the only way to expose, pre-empt, weaken and finally destroy them. This is a war of self-defence in its true sense, a campaign that the free world should undertake on behalf of its peoples and of the entire human race.
125.	For its part, Israel has been waging an unrelenting war on Arab terrorism and has dealt it a number of crippling blows. The so-called PLO, which had established its own mini-terrorist State in Lebanon, from which it carried out and assisted terrorist acts in five continents, was expelled from that country. But Israel cannot be expected to shoulder alone the burden of fighting international terrorism. Since we are all potential victims of terror, we must fight it together. If we do not, terrorism will endanger our basic freedoms and all the standards of civilized behaviour for which the United Nations stands.
126.	The attitude underpinning Arab terrorist attacks against Israel is the continued denial by Arab States of Israel's right to exist. Translated into wanton attacks on civilians, the ideology is cruel and inhuman. But it has produced the very opposite result to that intended. Israel has taken the necessary measures to protect its people and enable them to live and prosper alongside their Arab neighbours throughout the Land of Israel. We have to state with regret that any sign of ostensible moderation in the attitude of Arab Governments towards Israel is negated by their sustenance and support of terrorist organizations committed to Israel's destruction and by their continued attempts to expel Israel from United Nations bodies and other international organizations. We will welcome a change in the Arab stance if it is given concrete expression, such as a clear-cut disengagement from the so-called PLO and other terrorist organizations and a straightforward statement of readiness to make peace with Israel.
127.	Sadly, such a breakthrough for peace was set back by the General Assembly's rejection of the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, for no other reason than that certain Arab States reject the idea of peace with Israel. Camp David has been the only ray of light in an otherwise dismal and dark picture of hostility. It will continue to serve as a beacon of hope until its message is finally accepted by the peoples and Governments of our region.
128.	The United Nations can contribute to peace in the Middle East by a change of direction. It should embrace the idea of peace between Israel and its neighbours condemn the blatant attacks on Israel and reject outright the attempts to expel it from international forums. Recently, an attempt to expel Israel from the UPU was properly rejected by an overwhelming majority. It is now time for the United Nations as a whole to muster the courage to condemn such behaviour. It will mark an important milestone in rehabilitating the image of the United Nations and its standing in the world community.
129.	Recently, the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East was resurrected. It was advanced by a State that has no diplomatic relations with Israel and that recommends the participation of representatives of terrorist groups. The Arab-Israel dispute is not in need of another international forum. There have been more than enough such gatherings and proposals, and they have all proved futile. They served as a stage for propaganda and for competition between Arab States in the politics of public confrontation with Israel. A conference such as the one being proposed would strike a blow at the principle of direct negotiations, which has proved to be the only means of producing agreements between Israel and its neighbours, from the time of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949 through the Camp David accords in 1978.
130.	We therefore call on Member States that have the interest of peace at heart to bring their influence to bear on our Arab neighbours to the east and north to adopt the only successful and tested path to peace—direct negotiations with Israel.
131.	Such negotiations produced the agreement with Lebanon which was signed on 17 May 1983. That agreement provided for security arrangements against terrorism and an agreed basis for normal relations between our two countries across the recognized international boundaries. It was approved by the legislatures of Israel and Lebanon, but Syria and those that cannot tolerate the idea of peace with Israel destroyed it by the application of sheer, brutal force. The agreement was designed to lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the restoration of Lebanese independence and the establishment of security measures along the Lebanon- Israel border.
132.	Today, some 40,000 Syrian troops occupy 65 per cent of Lebanon and show no sign of any intention to leave. The Lebanese Government is dominated by Syria and is not capable of conducting free negotiations that would resolve its problems with Israel. Obviously, Israel will ensure its legitimate security needs and make the necessary arrangements in southern Lebanon to protect the people of northern Israel against any repetition of the terrorist attacks of recent years. I reiterate our readiness to withdraw all our forces from Lebanon, subject to the above-mentioned arrangements.
133.	By now it should be clear to everyone, including the Arab States in our area, that Israel has no interest in maintaining any military presence in Lebanon. But we have to make certain that after the last Israeli soldier leaves Lebanon, the terrorists will not return to attack us.
134.	Let me repeat: anyone, any people or State that is interested in the evacuation of the Israel army from Lebanon must see to it that the terrorist organizations expelled from Lebanon by Israel do not return to our borders to renew their attacks. This is an essential condition for peace. Israel is ready to cooperate in any serious effort towards a fair solution to this problem.
135.	Since the conclusion of the Camp David accords, Israel has repeatedly called on Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Arabs to join in negotiations for an agreement on autonomy. Unfortunately, Egypt has discontinued its participation in the talks, while Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs have refused to join them. Arab rejectionism and extremism continue to have a stranglehold on those who may have been willing to embark on the path of moderation and peace.
136.	From this rostrum, I turn yet again to our neighbours with the same call. Let us move forward together on a new path. Let us talk to one another. Let us engage in a common effort to resolve our conflicts, rather than perpetuate the negative attitudes which find frequent expression in this building.
137.	Until this call is heeded, Israel will continue to strive for an end to Arab rejectionist attitudes and aspire to mutual acceptance, tolerance, understanding and dialogue, which are consonant with the most basic goals of the United Nations.
138.	Israel is aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and of the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international arrangements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
139.	Israel has long been concerned by the dangers posed by nuclear armaments and has therefore consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
140.	We believe that the most credible barrier to proliferation in such a sensitive area as the Middle East is a freely negotiated nuclear-weapon-free zone. In this belief, we are encouraged by the Latin American experience and the recent progress towards establishing the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon- free zone.
141.	In the vital field of disarmament, we are impelled by a permanent moral imperative. Progress in this field is indispensable if we are to remove the nuclear threat. It may be a commonplace to say that time is running out, but it is nevertheless true. A very recent experience demonstrates that weapons, once they exist, are used. During the current terrible Iran- Iraq war, new non-conventional weapons, such as gas, have been used. This latest addition to the arsenal of fighting armies, against established international conventions and basic decency, cannot but arouse the deepest anxiety. It should be opposed vigorously by anyone concerned for the future of our civilization. All of us are aware that a moderation of the armament spiral, both conventional and non- conventional, will free huge resources needed for the welfare of mankind, in particular that of the developing countries.
142.	In conclusion, our mission is twofold. Our first task is the improvement of the quality of life in this world, especially for those who are suffering or who lack the means of sustenance; the hungry millions are waiting for us to do our duty. Our second task is to concert our efforts to eradicate from our midst terrorism and all other violations of civilized norms. We must dedicate equal effort to achieving both goals. We cannot accomplish our humanitarian task unless we overcome the dangers that threaten our society. Both objectives can be achieved provided we muster the courage and the will to do so. Our reward will be true peace. There can be no greater goal for the United Nations.
143.	The vision of our ancient prophets of universal peace was intended for a distant, Utopian future. But, if we succeed in removing these two formidable obstacles—hunger and terrorism—from our path, the march of humanity towards the fulfilment of that vision will be immeasurably advanced, our stride quickened and our hearts uplifted with the promise of better days."
5,1978,"ISR_prev_1998","70.	Mr. President, permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in this general debate by offering you the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will guide this session with fairness and wisdom.
71,	It is my pleasure also to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
72	As we reflect upon the work of the United Nations over the past year one undertaking stands out above all others: it is the noble attempt to reach an agreement on disarmament, to divert precious resources to improving the lot of the common man
73	In the Middle East we recently witnessed an unprecedented escalation in the quantity of weapons purchased by the Arab States, amounting to $11 billion in orders since the beginning of 1977. Indeed, over the past five years the arms agreements signed by those States mean that they have outstripped both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries members of the Warsaw Pact Organization in the ratio of their arms build-up.
74.	Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race and it remains ready to enter into agreements on arms limitation with all States in the Middle East. There is no doubt, however, that the appropriate way to bring about an arms reduction in the Middle East is through peace treaties which would include limitations on armaments within their framework Indeed, the mere transformation from a state of war to one of peace will move the States involved to dedicate their resources to economic development rather than military aims.
75.	Terrorist groups continue to threaten the lives of innocent men, women and children in different parts of the world. Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries did not continue to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. Yet we are gratified that States which once stood helplessly by have begun to assert themselves.
Mention should be made, for example, of the Federal Republic of Germany's rescue operation in Mogadishu and of the joint statement on international terrorism of the Heads of State 'or Government at the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference,6 wherein they recognized the need for immediate action to cease all flights to and from a country which refuses to extradite or prosecute hijackers of aircraft. It is only through such concerted and effective action that the world can be freed from organized terrorism.

76.	In the field of human rights no State should ignore a violation of human rights wherever it may occur in the world.
77.	Israel continues to follow closely the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. We welcome the recent increase in the number of exit visas issued, although a large number of Jews are still denied the elementary human rights to emigrate. In addition, administrative obstacles and arbitrary restrictions still threaten the social and economic livelihood and personal freedom of Jews seeking to emigrate.
78.	We have been particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences passed this year on Jews whose only crime is their desire to rejoin their families in Israel-Grigorij Goldstein, Iosif Begun, Ida Nudel, Vladimir Slepak, Simon Shnirman and Anatoly Scharansky. Those sentences caused bitter protest and indignation throughout the world. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and allow those who want to emigrate to Israel and rejoin their families to do so.
79.	We cannot be silent in the face of the increasing incitement of feeling against and defamation of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, their religion, culture and national movement, manifested day after day in the official Soviet media. Those anti-Semitic attacks, unprecedented in their intensity, may have most dangerous consequences. In this regard it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their ancient traditions and culture, and in fact take severe measures against Jews who wish to do so. We appeal Jo the Soviet Union to allow Jewish culture to be expressed freely.
80.	We also deeply regret that the Syrian Government continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and be reunited with their relatives residing in other lands.
81.	One of the most important trends in world , politics today remains the determined aspiration of the new and under-developed nations to take their place in the international political and economic arena. Being a developing nation itself, Israel strongly identifies with the aspirations of nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America to transform their political independence into a full and equal economic partnership with the older-established nations of the world.
82 To that end the North-South dialogue, with its guidelines on the transfer of resources, marks an important
beginning, and the Government of Israel appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies in encouraging this process. My Government particularly welcomes the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires, where Israel proposed a voluntary agreement for the exchange of technical assistance among developing countries. Israel has been co-operating for more than 30 years with other developing nations in fields such as irrigation techniques, seed production, desalination, solar energy and the agricultural development of arid and semi-arid zones. We view the expansion of such co-operative efforts as vital if the serious food shortages that still exist in so much of the world are to be overcome .
83.	A year ago I addressed this Assembly on the prospects of launching a peace process in the Middle East. Today I have the satisfaction of being able to address the General Assembly on the new and positive developments that have taken place recently.
84.	As all members of the Assembly know, a few weeks ago at Camp David two framework agreements8 were signed by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and witnessed by President Jimmy Carter of the United States of America. Within a very few days from now negotiations will start between Israel and Egypt for the conclusion of a peace treaty between them.
85.	It is my hope that these negotiations will be successful and that before the year is out we shall witness the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. It is our desire that the peace process should eventually embrace the other States that are our neighbours—Jordan, Lebanon and Syria-so that we may achieve a comprehensive settlement in the area.
86.	The gratitude of my country goes out to President Jimmy Carter, whose devoted efforts have made the Camp David developments possible When this achievement ends with an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, President Carter's name will be recorded in history as that of a great peacemaker.
87.	I also wish to express my country's deep appreciation to President Anwar El-Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt for his wisdom and faith. His visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 turned a new page. He decided to enter into negotiations with Israel, to recognize Israel and to make peace with Israel. This change in policy ushered in a historic change in the relations between Egypt and Israel. The previous policy based on the ""three Nos"" of Khartoum 19679—no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel—prevented any progress towards a peace settlement.
88.	Now the road to peace lies open. The warm reception accorded to President El-Sadat by the people and Government of Israel constituted an acknowledgement of this change in the Egyptian policy. A new era of peace, for which Israel has been longing since its establishment, has started. Prime Minister Begin's courage and leadership were a decisive factor. Without his readiness and ability to assume responsibility for very painful decisions, the achievements reached at Camp David would not have been conceivable.
89.	Not only since the founding of the State of Israel but since the very beginning of the Zionist movement our dream has always been of a Middle East in which Jew and Arab would live in harmony and co-operation for the mutual advantage of both peoples.
90.	The Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is a step in this direction. It provides for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilian population from Sinai; for the establishment of normal relations between the two countries, including diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and full recognition; the termination of economic boycotts and of barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and mutual protection of citizens by due process of law. It also stipulates that there shall be free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, and that the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba are international waterways to be open to all nations for navigation and over flight.
91.	In view of the several wars launched by our neighbours, we are conscious of our security needs. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of normal relations between the two States, there will be security arrangements concerning the limitation of armaments and forces in the different areas on the basis of reciprocity.
92.	Moreover, the framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel also provides for the stationing of United Nations forces at Sham el Sheikh to ensure freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran. Similarly, there is a provision for their being stationed in northern Sinai, thus creating a ""buffer zone"" between the forces stationed in El-Arish and those in Gaza. These forces will not be removed unless such removal is approved by the Security Council of the United Nations. It should be noted here that in recent years the United Nations forces in the Middle East have played a constructive role with the framework of the various agreed arrangements in the. region.
93.	It has never been the wish of Israel to exercise control over the lives and activities of the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza.
94.	We want to live as equals with the Arab inhabitants of those areas. We want to live with them, not to replace them; but at the same time we do not regard ourselves as foreigners in those areas. The Israeli settlements in Judaea and Samaria and in the Gaza district are there as of right. It is inconceivable to us that Jews should be prohibited from settling and living in Judaea and Samaria, which are the heart of our homeland.
95.	We maintain our army positions in those areas in order to ensure the security of the population of Israel, the majority of whom live in the Mediterranean coastal area. The Israeli forces are there in order to protect Israel and not in order to interfere in the lives of the Arab inhabitants. Under the agreement for the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn from those areas once a self-governing authority is freely elected by their inhabitants. The Israeli defence forces will be redeployed in those areas and maintained for security purposes. The final status of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza and their relationship with their neighbours will be negotiated during a period of five years following the establishment of the self-governing authority.
96.	One of the subjects that will be discussed between the parties will undoubtedly be the question concerning Jerusalem. For us, the city of Jerusalem is the one and only eternal capital of Israel. We have not, and we shall never have, any other capital city, whether or not others recognize it as such. This eternal city is holy to three religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. However, our connexion with it is not just religious, but derives from the totality of Jewish national history. Jerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. It is now united once again, as it should be, free and open for all to come and go. All religious communities should be in complete control of their own holy places and of their own religious life, and all should enjoy the rights of free worship. The inhabitants of the city should live together in harmony with a representative municipal council supervising all essential functions. We have resolved never again to compromise the unity of Jerusalem, and it is our hope that other peoples will share our position.
97.	It was agreed at Camp David that a peace settlement in the Middle East should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council. Resolution 242(1967) is a carefully worked out set of principles establishing a framework of peace to be negotiated among the contending States. It makes clear mat the final borders must be negotiated bilaterally among the States concerned.
98 Let us hope that all those whose co-operation is essential in obtaining peace in the Middle East will not short-sightedly remain outside the peace process. We have to find agreed and appropriate ways for Jews and Arabs to live together in equality, trust and mutual respect.















"
5,1985,"ISR_prev_1998","Sir, at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for the fortieth session. I am convinced that your wealth of diplomatic experience and proven skills will contribute to the enrichment of the deliberations during this special session.
This year we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established with many hopes and expectations in the aftermath of a world distraught by death, destruction and the plunder of war.
Like many other peoples, but significantly different from them, the Jewish people underwent an ordeal which will leave its eternal mark not only in the long annals of its history but also in its deeper spiritual and psychological experience. This was, of course, the horrendous Holocaust which was wrought upon us by nazism and anti-semitism. For this reason the emergence of the United Nations provided a source of inspiration and light for us at the end of a very dark era in our history.
Indeed, what could be more stirring than the unequivocal declarations of principle appearing in the opening paragraphs of the United Nations Charter, such as: ""We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and the call ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors""? To my great regret, however, this Organization has had a part in shattering these aspirations and noble ideals.
The slander of anti-semitism has also been propagated in the guise of anti-zionism. In this context, we sadly note the tenth anniversary of the passing of the infamous General Assembly resolution falsely equating the Jewish National Liberation Movement - Zionism - with an outrageous phenomenon totally alien to the most fundamental and spiritual values of the Jewish heritage. That resolution, 3379 (XXX), of 10 November 1975, will be remembered in the history of the United Nations as a terrible blot on its record and a discredit to the Organization and to those irresponsible Members that supported it.
Other international forums have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda and political warfare against Israel, distorting the real purposes for which they were established. It would, therefore, be appropriate and timely to strive for what I would call ""political disarmament"" in these bodies, in order to guarantee that they maintain their integrity and credibility in the exercise of their legitimate functions.
Israel was established in 1948 against the background of a United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The United Nations, however, did nothing to implement its resolution, and the State of Israel came into being through the will, the toil and the sacrifice of its people. Nor, I might add, did the United Nations alleviate the immense threats and dangers that Israel had to face since its establishment.
Since the founding of the State we have made every possible effort towards the achievement of peace and the normalization of relations with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our national heritage. The Jewish people is a small, democratic and free people, striving to rebuild its renewed nationhood in its ancient homeland. We cherish peace and we teach its blessings to our children. Indeed, after a prolonged period of strife and hostility forced on us by our neighbors, we found a way to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
Egypt and Israel have demonstrated clearly that face-to-face negotiations and direct dialog are the most constructive and beneficial ways of achieving peace. This was brought about on the basis of the Camp David Accords, which established a just and effective framework for the settlement of conflicts. It is for this reason that Israel is so insistent on applying this framework to the further extension of the peace process. We hope that in the near future we shall be able to negotiate with Jordan, our neighbor to the East. It is crucial that the peace treaty with Egypt should not remain the sole example of peace with our neighbors, and therefore we earnestly seek to widen and deepen that peace by extending the process to include the rest of our Arab neighbors.
From this rostrum I once again urge King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct negotiations with Israel - not in some vague, deflecting international forum, but in direct, bilateral discussions. An international conference is a means of evading direct negotiations. It will be a stage for hostile and extreme propaganda and will not serve the cause of peace. Our aim should be the achievement of a bilaterally negotiated peace treaty between our countries. There is no change in our deep commitment to the Camp David accords, and we stand ready therefore to meet a Jordanian delegation, which may include Arab Palestinians from Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or other Arab Palestinians to be mutually agreed upon.
Israel firmly believes that there is no way to solve the problems of our region except through negotiations and peace. If King Hussein has finally decided to offer his hand in peace, let him act the way the late President Sadat did. He should not drown the quest for peace in a sea of conditions that nullify any chance of peace - conditions such as an international conference and the participation of terrorist organizations in the peace process. I should also like to urge King Hussein to free himself at this eleventh hour, from the clutches of the PLO. King Hussein has been caught in their clutches before and it seems that he has failed to learn from his own experience. Only after freeing himself from his dangerous association with the PLO terrorists will it be possible to achieve progress towards peace between Israel and Jordan. Indeed, the recent marked increase in terror attacks against Israelis stems, among other things, from Hussein's partnership with the PLO. Jordan cannot extend the olive branch of peace on the one hand and play host to terror at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.
Our position in this regard is clear and decisive. We are firmly against any contacts or dealings with terrorists or their representatives - and, in this case, with an organization whose declared purpose is the liquidation of Israel. PLO leaders have been intimating that they are engaged in the political process of peace. However, they have been waging cruel and murderous terrorist activity all along. According to their declared program, political action and terrorist activities should go hand in hand until they achieve their goal, the elimination of Israel. He are not ready to negotiate with terror. There is no place for its self-proclaimed representatives at a table where peace, security and tranquility are to be negotiated. Acknowledging that organization would be tantamount to legitimizing terror, and should be rejected by all those who value peace.
To protect our people and territory from terror, we were obliged to act against the PLO terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, which posed an intolerable threat to our people in the Galilee region.
Meanwhile, terror continues to wreak havoc in Lebanon. The latest outrage was the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats in Beirut. Kidnapping and the holding of hostages for ransom is only one of the manifestations of international terrorism, whose linchpin is the PLO, which we roust fight and stamp out. This is another example of the fact that terror knows no bounds, neither political nor any other.
The removal of the various threats from Israel's northern border continues to be an important priority for us. We will do all in our power to defend and protect the population of the north. This objective has become no less important in the wake of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanon, in accordance with the decision of the Government of Israel of 14 January 1935.
Yesterday Israel took action against terror bases, this time in Tunisia. Israel's air force acted against the terrorists only after it became evident that the terrorists were mounting attacks from Tunis with impunity. Only last week, PLO terrorists, who were directed and commanded from Tunis, attacked an Israeli boat in Larnaca, Cyprus, and murdered three Israeli civilians in cold blood. In recent months, those headquarters were responsible for a number of seaborne attempts
against our people, which were prevented by Israel's navy. We had no intention of attacking Tunisia, although that country has permitted terrorist bases to exist on its soil. We acted against murderous criminals in order to prevent the continuation of their criminal acts.
The United Nations has been sadly remiss in meeting the challenge of international and PLO terror. It could and should have come out resolutely against this evil phenomenon of our time and placed it outside the pale of civilization. Instead, it has equivocated and, worse, legitimized terror in terms that have provided encouragement to the terrorists and their supporters.
I regret to state that, in spite of numerous outrages and continuing attacks by PLO terrorists, this issue has never been seriously addressed by the Security Council or other United Nations and international forums. Israel cannot be expected to ignore this double standard. In spite of this, Israel is willing to act with other free nations to curb, if not stamp out, terrorism. Similarly, we urge joint international action against terrorists and their sponsors.
Among the most distressing and oppressing phenomena of our international experience is racism. The very word evokes dark and brutal memories of the long history of the Jewish people. Apartheid is a system of discrimination which the Jewish faith and the State of Israel totally reject and repudiate. The Government of Israel, on 11 August 1985, reiterated that it is unconditionally opposed to the policy of apartheid in South Africa and to any discrimination on grounds of race, religion or color or on any other grounds.
Israel has diplomatic relations with some of the African States and we are ready to renew our relations with those with which we do not have them. This is, of course, up to them. We believe that many have by now seen who the real friends of Africa are: it is not those who use high-flown words but will not lend a helping hand in time of need and distress, or those who remember Africa only when they need its votes at the United Nations. The State of Israel, in contrast, was one of the first to reach out to the nations of Africa, in their early years of sovereignty and statehood and in their current travails, and we are ready to increase our efforts.
In the area of disarmament the nations of the Middle Bast are confronted with three main challenges. These are the reduction of conventional arms, the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the eradication of the use. of chemical warfare. My Government believes that concerted regional action on all three issues is a moral imperative of the highest priority.
Concerning the accumulation of conventional arras, Israel voices its concern over the accelerated supply of large quantities of weapons to a number of belligerent Arab Governments in our region. These regimes do not need these arms for their defense, but are stockpiling them to use against Israel. This can only serve to undermine the chances for peace in the Middle East.
On the subject of nuclear weapons, we believe that the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation in so sensitive an area as the Middle Bast is a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, based on a system of obligations binding' on all States concerned. Israel stands ready to begin such negotiations without delay or preconditions.
While Israel is conscious of the necessity to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are also aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful use of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international agreements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
Another issue that arouses the deepest anxiety is the repeated use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and the danger that such use may spread in a manner that could not easily be reversed, if at all. It is tragic that the sixtieth anniversary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbidding the use of such weapons should be commemorated in this manner. This total disregard for solemn international legal obligations by Iraq demonstrates the difficulty of achieving genuine disarmament. But we must not despair; we must continue our efforts in this vital field of human endeavor.
The deteriorating situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union obliges us once again to speak out in defense of their elementary rights. Our concern relates especially to the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who have indicated their desire to join their people in Israel. The Soviet authorities, however, in flagrant violation of the Helsinki Final Act and many other international obligations assumed by the Soviet Government, refuse them permission to leave.
Many of those Jews who have been denied permission to leave are forced to live as outcasts from Soviet society, subject to all manner of official harassment and persecution, while being effectively deprived of the means of legal redress. Increasing numbers have been engulfed in recent months in an accelerating wave of arrests, trials and savage sentences of imprisonment on trumped-up criminal charges. Jews seeking to disseminate knowledge of the Hebrew language have been prominent among these recent victims of judicial repression. These Jews are in no way violating Soviet law, nor are they involved in any form of anti-Soviet activity. Their real crimes, in the eyes of the authorities, are their persistent demand to leave for Israel and their efforts, in the face of strenuous official opposition, to perpetuate their Jewish heritage, culture and religion.
All of these outrages are taking place against the background of a relentless campaign of anti-semitic incitement, usually camouflaged as anti-zionism, in the officially controlled media - a campaign designed by the authorities to encourage an attitude of suspicion, hatred and contempt towards Soviet Jews on the part of the Soviet population.
We call upon all persons of goodwill and all Governments in the civilized world to join us in our protests and in urging the Soviet authorities to conform their policies towards Soviet Jewry to the international obligations solemnly undertaken by the Soviet Government.
Israel seeks good relations with all States including, naturally, the Soviet Union. We have looked to the new Soviet leadership for signs of change in its attitude towards Soviet Jewry. Regrettably, so far we have seen no positive changes whatsoever. .We therefore have no choice but to continue to expose energetically and protest vigorously these flagrant violations of the rights of our fellow Jews seeking to join their people in Israel. He shall continue to do so untiA every Soviet Jew who so wishes is free to exercise this basic right.
There is also the problem of the Jews of Syria, who are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies and are not free to choose to live wherever they wish. This is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Syria is a signatory. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return.
Several hundred young Jewish women remain unmarried because of the depleted male Jewish population in Syria. The Syrian Government has cruelly refused to allow those women to leave the country in order to be able to marry within their faith and establish families.
tJe are also concerned about the small, ancient Jewish community left in Ethiopia, because of its isolation and suffering and the latest disasters that have befallen that country. Some of these Jews have already returned to their historic homeland and have been received as long-lost brothers and sisters who have finally returned home.
The people of Israel and its Government have expressed their solidarity with the Ethiopian people, which has undergone much suffering as a result of the recent famine and other difficulties. We appeal to the Ethiopian Government to respect the cultural and religious rights of the Jewish community and to enable it to continue to maintain its heritage and religion and, on humanitarian grounds, to permit those among them who so desire to be reunited with their families in Israel.
The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations may be a fitting occasion for a review and reappraisal of its activities, in frank and constructive self-criticism.
The United Nations should not merely celebrate its past but also plan for its future.
Some may feel disheartened by the fact that, after so many years of United Nations preoccupation with the problems of the developing countries, we still remain so distant from the goal of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich nations of the world. Poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease still characterize the conditions of life in many parts of the world.
One inescapable conclusion is that progress has too often been hampered by a tendency to substitute slogans for serious plans of action. Meeting the world's pressing economic and social problems will require new dimensions of international co-operation. The danger of famine continues to afflict developing countries. There is dire need for urgent action by the world community. The peoples of Africa are struggling to free themselves from the curses of poverty and hunger, and the rest of the world must help them in this struggle.
The vital element of developing traditional agriculture has been sorely neglected. Israel is now preparing an aid proposal for more efficient food delivery systems that would provide better nutrition and would link such aid with land and water development programs.
The success of integrated rural development has been proved in Israel's own rapid agricultural development. Israel has much experience in the proper use of soil and water, marketing organization, agro-industrial systems appropriate for developing countries, and the integration of populations and development projects. He are ready to share our know-how in these fields with other developing countries. The benefits of this experience can contribute to raising living standards in many societies.	4
Israel has presented to international organizations, both within and outside the United Nations, a development proposal entitled ""Transitional Economy"". It seeks to break the vicious circle of poverty by improving the productivity and quality of life in developing countries. The proposed program seeks to combine a comprehensive development process with decentralized planning and implementation.
In the 26 years of Israel's involvement in international development efforts, Israel has co-operated with more than 100 countries and trained over 50,000 men and women in agriculture, in rural development and in health and education. During Israel's development it encountered some of the same problems that are now facing African countries and has successfully overcome them.
The United Nations may recapture some of its prestige and authority if it gives priority to these pressing social and economic issues. The magnitude of the tasks before us will require unprecedented international co-operation.
Unfortunately, the United Nations record is not very encouraging. At its last session the General Assembly had 143 items on its agenda. It passed no less than 38 resolutions relating to the Middle East, out of which 37 were negative, even hostile, in their reference to Israel. Such resolutions have long ceased to attract any attention or carry any weight. Yet the General Assembly did not see fit to address itself to such danger-spots as the Iraq-Iran war and Afghanistan, or to many of the socio-economic problems which plague our society.
Let us put aside the political differences that beset our world and join forces in an effort to find solutions for the ordinary man, woman and child, who are too often ignored in the heat of political debate. Let us work together in the spirit of the ancient prophets who gave to the world the concept of the brotherhood of man, a concept which has been the basis for the great ideals of mankind.
In the present age of unprecedented opportunities, Israel calls upon all Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations to rise to the challenge offered by science and technology. Let us share the fruits of scientific and technological advances to improve our lives. Let us build a moral and prosperous future to achieve justice and dignity for all. Let the United Nations become, truly, a ""United Nations for a better world""."
5,1996,"ISR_prev_1998","Allow
me first, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his
unanimous election as President of the General Assembly
at its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I
would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas
do Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried
out his duties.
The succession of Governments, which is a defining
principle of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to
power a new Government in Israel. A section of the
international community has deemed this democratic Israeli
choice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against
regional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to
make a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for
peace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers
on one side and mischief-makers and people who reject
peace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right
converge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and
differences notwithstanding.
I wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab
peace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding
the practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new
majority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve
peace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding
landmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The
Madrid Conference, to which I had the honour of
contributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of
peace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are
the direct heirs.
The firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government
with respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the
peace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and
Jordan, helped to shape. However, my Government’s swift
engagement in the peace process has been minimized,
reduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel
and I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian
Authority have been met with sarcasm and given only
secondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely
with the substance and the content of peace. They
initiated the ways and means necessary for the
achievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of
the Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian
recognition to new sections of society and Israeli political
classes. It is Israel’s determination to reach peace
according to the policies and fundamental guidelines of
the new Government.
On its road to peace, the Government of Israel is
guided by several principles, which I would like to
expound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a
blind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a
region where, unfortunately, threats and instability still
rage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture
of peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along
behind a process in which terrorism and violence have not
yet spoken their last word.
Negotiations themselves, through their joint creative
energies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The
battle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its
sources of financing and assistance is not only for us to
fight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations
relentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It
is imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process free from violence.
I have just returned from the Washington summit,
held at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of
the Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this
rostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State
of the United States for their exemplary contribution to
peace by bringing the parties together and for their
profound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.
In this respect the role and contribution of the United
States remain of great importance.
On Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will
convene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in
respect of the various agreements. We are responsible to
our people and to our whole region in this matter. We
must therefore display good faith and mutual
understanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send
out the message of stable peace and lasting security.
12


The Washington summit reconfirmed the principles
and guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself
wholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-
to-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the
key to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the
renunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of
mutual efforts for peace.
The choice is in our hands. Will we opt for
cooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we
revert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and
violence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,
Israel has chosen hope.
Another major principle in our search for peace is the
will of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.
Regional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace
and stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic
hegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of
regional cooperation. This is a basic principle of
normalization. Peace and normalization are one and
indivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of
peace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization
taken hostage and brought to a halt.
Israel makes no secret that normalization of its
relations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.
This means comprehensive political and economic relations,
and the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual
acceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a
body foreign to the region. Normalization must erase
forever the residue of this ideological negation.
Normalization is the indispensable cement for keeping
together the edifice of peace.
One of our immediate goals is the resumption of
negotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid
principles, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two
countries. We recognize Syria’s important role in the
establishment of lasting peace in our region. From this
rostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume
negotiations.
As to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with
Lebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon
can be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and
the building of peace.
Egypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our
partners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have
always been engaged in all stages of the peace process.
Jordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the
building of peace in our region. A man of peace and
dialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively
supported the peace process and has provided a vital
guarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed
his complete support.
On the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,
the country of my birth and family roots, has always
walked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab
reconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King
Hassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-
Israeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his
essential role and breathe into peace the remarkable
inspiration of his solidarity.
I would like to pay tribute also to the active support
of Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania
have all helped to consolidate peace efforts.
The peace process has benefitted from the
considerable support of the co-sponsors, the United States
and Russia, and from the active and positive contribution
of the European Union and Norway and of Powers such
as Japan and Canada.
Once again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’s
irreversible commitment and determination to pursue the
path of peace.
Since the dawn of history our region has been a
meeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a
vibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the
crossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East
must, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this
place and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs
and Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to
regenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and
humanity.
Through international cooperation, Israel is sharing
with young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin
America to China, its achievements and assets in the
fields of agriculture, health and science.
We hope that the day will come when a regional
security system will be established in the Middle East to
provide a cooperative multilateral response to all security
problems. The advantage of this regional approach is that
it is based on direct negotiations between the States of the
region. The first stage is to build confidence, and
thereafter we must put arms control and disarmament
13


mechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the
establishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security
Working Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope
that in the future this framework will encompass all States
of the Middle East.
Israel’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set
ambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and
realistically. After peace and reconciliation have been
established among all the States of the region, Israel will
endeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as
ballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to
rigorous verification.
Negotiations to establish such a zone will commence
following the signing of bilateral peace accords between
Israel and all the countries of the region. In the meantime
Israel will implement confidence-building measures that
will increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make
a contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed
conflict.
We generally prefer regional security arrangements.
However, Israel is in favour of the implementation of
certain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control
and disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel
signed the Convention on conventional weapons and
adopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of
anti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty
against the use of chemical weapons and now the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will
consider ratification of that Treaty depending upon
developments in the region, particularly the adoption of that
Treaty by the major countries.
Israel has thus demonstrated its determination to be
involved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the
international community to prevent the spread of
conventional and non-conventional weapons.
Israel strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged
member of the family of nations represented in this
Organization. We note with regret and deep disappointment
that the question of our membership in a regional group has
still not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right
available to all States Members of the United Nations to
participate on an equal footing in all its activities. This
impairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations
under the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this
injustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able
to act within this Organization on the same footing as all
other Member States.
It is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name
is invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to
conclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great
religions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and
ensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression
for all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality
to which Israel has made a profound contribution.
Jerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,
has throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the
summit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in
ancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the
capital of any country other than Israel.
Rarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied
the right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people
of peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,
has returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:
Jerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving
devotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of
peace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shall
tirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.




"
5,1997,"ISR_prev_1998","I would like to begin by
congratulating the President on his unanimous election to
preside over the fifty-second session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this
session the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations
closer to each other and in finding ways to address the
challenges that face all countries and nations, north and
south, east and west.
I also wish to congratulate his predecessor,
Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in
which he carried out his duties.
We mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the
peace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,
Menachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar
Sadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their
courageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first
peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.
Throughout their entire history, the people of Israel
have aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant
call for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any
effort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,
a partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek
channels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.
In recent years, since 1991, after the principles for
negotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at
Madrid, we have achieved a number of important
advances with the establishment of full peace between
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the
signing of interim accords with the Palestinians.
Nevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and
negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and
Lebanon still lie ahead of us.
Immediately after the last elections, the Government
of Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the
Oslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the
past year we have spared no effort to implement those
accords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood
of the entire process has been undermined as a result of
the failure of the Palestinians to carry out their
commitments according to the agreements they have
signed.
In the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we
have endured many tests and have suffered ongoing
terrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration
for peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the
shedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,
women and children cut down by barbaric terrorist
attacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over
the loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has
not been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of
Israel.
The citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves
great risks for peace, but there is none among them who
is willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being
demanded in the name of peace. We must break this
tragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in
confronting the terror that trust will be re-established and
the doubts regarding intentions be removed.
As I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of
this Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for
peace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both
right and left are united in this quest.
If trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity
is honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We
have already proved our willingness to do so, through our
decisions and actions since taking office and in the
signing and implementation of the Hebron agreement in
all its aspects.
Peace cannot live side by side with continued
incitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in
essence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of
25


violence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the
honouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.
These principles apply throughout the world and must
apply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel
tracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a
second track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues
unimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct
challenge and affront to the very concept of peace.
Terror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not
a spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen
terrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of
innocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare
organizations, while under this cover they contribute to the
preparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.
Terror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any
moment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie
in its path.
Those who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill
Israelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be
accepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It
must be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must
be fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its
constant threat.
The words of the President of the United States and of
the Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few
days ago are important and should guide us all in this
matter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this
very rostrum:
“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable
political act.” [See Official Records of the General
Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th
meeting]
Thus, the international community bears the responsibility
for ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,
recognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.
In the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority
and Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the
Palestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this
commitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again
one year ago at the Washington summit and again in the
Hebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been
proved that this commitment has not been upheld as
required, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.
Israel stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian
Authority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against
terror. The Authority must act jointly and in full
cooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We
seek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the
implementation of signed agreements. The fight against
terror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian
interest.
In response to the repeated crises in the process
caused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live
up to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of
conduct for relations between us. This code should
include, first, the rejection of violence as a means for
achieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the
framework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain
from attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto
the international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of
permanent channels of communication, including in times
of crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call
to violence and jihad, and their replacement with the
language of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,
the advancement and encouragement of normalization and
support for regional activities.
The purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate
uninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to
create an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond
to the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe
that the adoption of the above principles will allow us to
overcome the present crisis and help in preventing future
ones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game
will also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders
and greater confidence between the peoples.
In the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the
United States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has
been reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace
process to its proper track. We have been conducting
intensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the
United States, both in Washington and here, with a view
to resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to
reach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.
Israel values and appreciates the action of the United
States Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts
to extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to
bring the parties closer together and to ensure the success
of the negotiations. We are fully committed to these
efforts.
26


Israel reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated
negotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on
permanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in
which the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and
the way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended
to hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to
delay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the
Palestinian Authority.
The international community can play an important
role in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which
will make it possible for us to resolve our differences
through direct negotiations. It is only through direct
negotiations that we can bring this process to a successful
conclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or
pressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the
dispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the
United Nations and other international forums only serve to
create unnecessary obstacles and to make already
entrenched positions more rigid.
The comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be
achieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and
Lebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and
agreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to
resolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to
find in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for
a just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in
favour of peace — the “peace of the brave”, as claimed by
its leadership — then we must explore together every
possible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing
the talks between us.
Israel cannot accept the continued violence and terror
on its northern border. The terrorist activities of
organizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha
rockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the
threat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.
There is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.
We wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon
acting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that
operate from its territory.
If we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only
with agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means
normalization, open borders, freedom of movement,
commerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire
region. These are the soul and essence of peace.
Normalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.
The decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab
League at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week
ago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for
peace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to
prevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of
existing relations with it, to close liaison and interests
offices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to
reactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a
boycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which
is reversing the process.
The ongoing and intentional freeze of the
multilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the
entrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant
and should serve as a platform and incentive for building
peace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral
channels alike and not make one conditional upon the
other, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road
to peace. The question mark hanging over the regional
economic conference scheduled to take place later this
year in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative
drive.
The countries of the Middle East that are party to
the peace effort have a common interest in regional
stability and the advancement of prosperity and well-
being for all the nations of the region. We face together
the growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding
desert. We are also facing dangers from within our region
that threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of
various nations and to plunge the entire region into
violence, war and bloodshed.
It was only a few years ago that the entire world
was forced into forming a coalition to combat an
aggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring
country and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face
new and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of
recent experience have not been learned and many
countries turn a blind eye to the threat.
The leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms
that threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.
Yet the international community continues to remain deaf
and refuses to speak out against Iran's policies,
declarations and actions.
Iran's efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire
operational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds
represent the greatest threat to security and stability in the
Middle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran's
weapons programme extend far beyond the geographical
confines of our region. They threaten the security of other
27


members of the international community and their interests.
Israel reiterates its call to the members of the
international family of nations — and at their head the
United States, Russia and the members of the European
Union and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —
to exercise the full weight of their influence and to take
concrete steps to prevent this development, which
represents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.
After the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties
between Israel and every country of the region, it will be
possible to create a regional security system that would
provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of
security problems in the Middle East, including a mutually
and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These
are our goals and we must act to achieve them.
Israel is an active and responsible member of the
family of nations represented in this body. However, 50
years after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November
1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the
State of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this
Organization.
We attach great importance to the fundamental reform
of the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of
other United Nations Member countries that believe that the
Organization urgently requires greater efficiency and a
redirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its
truly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced
that no reform can be completed so long as the question of
Israel's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.
We call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.
Much to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an
intensification of the political campaign waged against
Israel at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes
the peace process and further undermines confidence
between the parties. We call upon the Member States to
refrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The
time has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of
resolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and
to contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive
to direct negotiations between the parties.
As part of Israel's international and regional
commitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in
cooperative programmes with many countries, with which
we share the experience and knowledge we have acquired
in various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its
international cooperation programme and to assisting
various peoples to address the challenges of development
and the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.
Over more than three decades, tens of thousands of
trainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their
own countries within the framework of Israel's
cooperation and assistance programme in the fields of
education, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and
leadership. We are especially proud of the participation in
recent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst
them Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of
goodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the
message and the great hope of human well-being. As in
the words of the prophet:
“Each shall help his neighbour and make him
strong”.
This year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the
world marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years
ago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in
its ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our
2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we
would renew our national life in the land of our
forefathers, the land of Israel.
It is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this
aspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its
land. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its
ancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant
and democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,
research and industry.
For the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure
Israel's security and independence, while always seeking
peace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty
years on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.
This week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish
new year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye
towards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the
peace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of
hope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the
shofar is accompanied by the prayer:
“may the year and its troubles pass and a new year
and its blessings begin”.




"
5,1971,"ISR_prev_1998","60.	 Mr. President, you come to the leadership of the General Assembly at a time when eastern Asia stands in the center of international concern. It is in that region alone that war still rages day by day. It is there that a burden of suffering, unparalleled elsewhere, weighs heavily on the conscience of mankind. And it is to Asia that our eyes will turn when we come to take decisions on the future of this Organization and the principles underlying its structure.
61.	It is right at such a time that an Asian statesman of high capacity and repute should preside over our deliberations. Israel wishes you success and pledges itself to your support. You will be fortified by the high example of your eminent predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, and by the experience and patient skill of the Secretary-General, who is completing a full decade of service to the international cause.
62.	Last year the United Nations marked its twenty-fifth anniversary by an act of celebration. I suggested then that the occasion could have been more wisely used for scrutiny and self-criticism (1851st meeting]. There is a manifest decline in the influence of the General Assembly on the main issues affecting human welfare and destiny. Its resonance has diminished. The central currents of international life and policy flow outside its walls. The frustration arises, not so much from defects in the Organization's work, as from discord and contention amongst the Powers. Yet there are some causes which lie within our capacity of correction. I shall mention one.
63.	In the work of the United Nations there is a strong accent on public controversy and a relative neglect of private conciliation. A report by the Secretary-General 11 years ago contained a plea to give greater emphasis to the United Nations as an instrument for negotiation of settlements as distinct from this world debate of issues. The advice was not heeded. Debate, not negotiation, still dominates the United Nations practice. Resolutions are adopted in great numbers, but their texts bear witness to the parliamentary advantages of fragmentation rather than to a balanced view of rights or realities.
64.	For example: in a dispute in the Middle East between two parties one of which has a single vote and the other 16 or, in practice 40, the preordained triumph of automatic majorities has no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory. The same is true of the Security Council, a third of whose members have their diplomatic relations and their ethnic or sentimental predilections exclusively on one side.
65.	This difficulty would not exist if the organs of the United Nations would regard it as their main function to seek consensus which would include the interested parties. They would be better employed in encouraging agreement between the parties at issue, than in sharpening controversy between them by attempts at adjudication. In short, the United Nations should aspire to a diplomatic rather than to a parliamentary role. The test of achievement should be not how many resolutions we have voted but how many solutions we have advanced.
66.	And, indeed, wherever free, direct negotiation has taken place across the world in the past year there has been fruitful issue. There have been the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, based, as Mr. Gromyko significantly told us, ""on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers"" [1942nd meeting, para. 101]. He was referring to the frontiers established after the war by negotiation and agreement. There has been the four-Power agreement on Berlin where, as Mr. Gromyko again correctly said, it is now up to the two parties directly concerned ""to complete the negotiations between them"" [ibid., para. 98]. There has been the normalization of relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been direct contact between the United States and the People's Republic of China, to be followed at an early date by a meeting at the highest level of responsibility. The Paris talks on Viet-Nam, with the direct participation of all the parties at issue, have been accompanied by a constant de-escalation of the fighting. There is grave tension between India and Pakistan, as is evident from the general debate here earlier this week; but the two Governments have direct relations which they ca« apply to the solution of their differences. Many hearts are heavy at the reports coming from the boundary between Ireland and
Northern Ireland; but there is also news that the heads of Government concerned have met each other and agreed on a process of political reconciliation. In Washington, agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are being signed today for modernizing the ""hot line"" and strengthening safeguards against accidental war.
67.	Is there no lesson to be drawn from the settlements reached and attempted this year? Surely they show that the air is alive with a spirit of innovation. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to be an organic part of our generation's life are now yielding to a strong impulse for peaceful settlement. Above all we are learning lessons about the immense importance of communication. Time and again the decision of Governments to abandon their cold separation and make contact with each other develops from a procedural advance into a change of substantive positions and thence into binding agreements. The central themes of international life in 1971 are direct contact, the abandonment of traditional conflicts, and flexible, pragmatic negotiation.
68.	There is also a move away from dogmatic attachment to documents. If old formulas and texts have reached deadlock, new ones are sought. There is a particular recognition that after wars the need is to build new systems of relations and not to reproduce the conditions and situations out of which war erupted. This new empiricism affects the juridical domain as well. Governments which seriously seek peace do not hesitate to confer directly with Governments which they do not yet recognize and with which they have no legal relations,
69.	If there is frustration in the Middle East it is because our region is still the exception to all the positive rules which have been applied elsewhere. Whatever is tried successfully in other regions is avoided in the Middle East. Here alone there is still no contact between the parties at issue. Here alone the Governments which will have to live side by side with each other have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. Here alone we are often told that the only way to get peace is to restore the situations which erupted in war. Here alone it is said in many places that the resumption of an important peace mission is wholly dependent on a single memorandum on which there is deadlock, and that there is no room for any innovation or any versatility of formulas and techniques.
70.	It is true, despite these failures, that the situation in the Middle East today is less explosive than a year ago. The flow of events has not been backward. The cease-fire along the Suez Canal has been effective, with rare and isolated exceptions, for 14 months. Israel does not propose to bring it to an end and Egypt would achieve nothing by violating it. Indeed, the only certainty in the Middle East is that resumed hostilities would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The absence of fighting along the Suez Canal line has released the Middle East and the world from the daily prospect of escalation involving the Soviet forces which were irresponsibly introduced into the' region with the effect of aggravating and enlarging a local tension. There has been a sharp decline in the strength and prestige of the terrorist groups and the pirate organizations that loomed so large a year ago. There has been peaceful movement across open bridges into Israel and the administered territories of scores of thousands of Arabs from neighboring Arab countries which are officially ""at war"" with Israel. Thus new patterns of coexistence have grown up between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in daily life and work. Side by side with a violent and incendiary Arab rhetoric there seem to be here and there some beginnings of a greater realism in Arab thinking on the problem of Israel's sovereignty and Israel's deep roots in the life and history of the Middle East. Finally, there are three separate availabilities of good offices which, although not all in active course today, are mutually accepted by the parties: the Jarring mission; the good offices of the United States in pursuit of an agreement concerning the Suez Canal; and the intention of ten African Presidents to authorize four eminent heads of State to go to Jerusalem and Cairo on a mission of information and goodwill.
71.	Yet, with all these consolations the peace efforts are not sufficiently intense. The talks under Ambassador Jarring's auspices, which began in high promise in January, have been at a standstill since the end of February. An exchange of views and positions on a special Suez Canal agreement was inaugurated through the good offices of the United States in April. This effort is still underway, but its pace is slow. In discussing the obstacles to peace it would be easy, but sterile, to fall into recrimination. Nothing would be easier. One of the few things that all Members of the United Nations have in common is the ability to discuss each other's imperfections. Yet what mankind longs to hear is not how deadlocks arose, but how it is proposed to overcome them. The general debate will be well used if Middle Eastern States will give precise definition to what they are prepared to do in order to bring a peaceful settlement into view. All who seek an understanding of Israel's policies must come face to face with two elements in the national mood. There is a sharp preoccupation with security; and there is a vivid memory of the horror and dark peril from which we emerged four years ago.
72.	In reflecting on the theme of security, Israel cannot easily forget the immense loss and burden it has borne through the hostility directed against it for over two decades. Our danger, in 1967 was the climax, but not the whole story, of our predicament. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual survival. Israel's insistence on genuine and stable security takes particular depth from the hideous legacy of Jewish massacre in the European slaughter-house. No people in history has undergone an experience of such tragic depth and scope. And no other State has grown for 23 years amidst such a comprehensive effort to deny it every breath of life.
73.	In particular, Israel's mind preserves a permanent and,, unfading image of the danger and solitude from which it emerged in the summer of 1967. To forget or ignore these memories is to renounce all true understanding of the Middle Eastern reality today. It was only by exceptional vigilance and cruel sacrifice that we repelled a monstrous design that would have ended our people's historic journey and cast all Israel's life and achievement into the flames. Maritime blockade, terrorist incursions, military encirclement, declarations of overt war, a frenzied torrent of threats and a formal announcement from Cairo that the battle was joined for Israel's destruction all these came
together in cumulative assault,""We recall the outrageous silence and apathy with which the Security Council, between one adjournment and the next, calmly observed the only attempt in modern history to wipe a sovereign State off the map of the world. Mr. Gromyko indulges his sense of humour when he tells us that guarantees by the Security Council are among ""the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world"" [ibid.., para. 135], The truth has Iden and is that, largely as a result of Soviet policy, the Security Council for 20 years has refused to defend any Israeli right including the right not to have its citizens killed, its ports blockaded, its existence threatened. The policy of the Security Council has been to refuse to adopt any decision of which a single word is unpalatable to the Arab Governments. It has thus surrounded every assault on Israeli lives, Israeli rights and Israeli security with indulgence. At the highest point of tension and of Israel's danger in May 1967, with Israel blockaded and encircled on every side, with all mankind gripped by the apprehension of approaching war, the suggestion of the Soviet Union was that the Security Council should go home and refuse to discuss such an ""artificial"" matter as the declaration of active war and the formal imposition of a blockade against a Member State. It is largely because of Soviet policy that the Security Council cannot be a guarantor of any Israeli rights. And the future development in the composition of the Security Council, however essential for other reasons, is bound to emphasize its inability to guarantee or even to express an Israeli interest, whatever the majority of its members may think or say.
74.	There are few effective guarantees of peace beyond those inherent in the nature of the peace itself. The greatest danger is lest through lassitude of spirit or impatience or imprecision of diplomatic craftsmanship we again revert to fragile, false and ambiguous solutions, which carry in them the seed of future wars.
75.	But the work of peace, however complex, must be attempted. Israel's deepest aspiration is to take part in a new deployment of energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East. Accordingly I ask the crucial questions: Is the slow rhythm of the peace efforts inevitable? Can nothing be done or at least attempted to set some dialog in swifter motion? Do Israel's policies offer openings through which roads to peace can be discerned and actively explored? My answer is that if the Arab States, and especially Egypt, sincerely desire an honorable and lasting peace, there are many roads leading to that goal.
76.	The first road lies in a Suez Canal agreement. There are many reasons for giving priority to this at attempt. A sudden transition from a conflict of more than two decades to a total settlement has proved difficult. It may be more rational to expect progress by stages. Each stage would bring about a solution of a specific problem while opening the way to further agreements and thus to final peace.
77.	The Suez Canal sector calls urgently for disengagement. It is there that the regional tension is compounded by the military presence of a great Power. Disengagement of forces here is an urgent international interest.
78.	The President of Egypt proposed on 4 February an attempt to open the Suez Canal ahead of a total settlement.
Israel's Prime Minister responded on 9 February. Both Governments subsequently agreed that the United States should use its good offices to explore the prospect. We therefore have an agreed objective and an agreed modality. , We believe that the effort to bridge the gulf between the positions of the parties should be pursued in the general interest of peace. If agreement cannot be reached on such a clearly defined issue in which Egyptian advantage is so strong it would appear to be even more difficult to advance in one step towards an over-all settlement in which all the complex issues would Ml into place. But the contrary is also true. A concrete result in this matter will accelerate and inspire negotiation and agreements on other issues. The peace effort will acquire momentum. It will be surrounded for the first time by an air of confidence and promise.
79.	Having been invited to give its views on this matter, Israel developed a proposal that an arrangement be agreed upon with a view to the opening of the Suez Canal to be cleared and operated by Egypt. Israel would make a withdrawal of its forces from the water-line to an agreed distance. The fighting would not be resumed. Egypt would clear and open the Canal. It would be agreed that there be free passage for all ships and cargoes, including those of Israel. Effective and agreed supervision procedures would be established. Means of deterrence against the danger of violation of the agreement would be assured. The agreement would stand on its own feet, but it would not affect or annul the undertakings which the parties gave in August 1970 to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in conformity with his mandate under Security Council resolution 242(1967). The line to be held by Israeli forces in accordance with that Canal agreement would not be considered final. When agreement on a final boundary is reached in the framework of the peace settlement Israeli forces will withdraw to it.
80.	We hope that Egypt will give this proposal the detailed and careful consideration which seemed to be its intention in April. It represents far-reaching concessions on Israel's part. It involves a movement from the cease-fire line ahead of peace. It mitigates the accepted legitimate principle that no withdrawal need take place ahead of a contractual and mutually agreed peace. The prestige, benefits and revenues from the Canal, the possible return of three quarters of a million people who live near the Canal in peaceful times, as well as the crossing of the Canal by Egyptian civilian personnel, would all be Egyptian, not Israeli, gains. A new impetus would be given to the Jarring mission, which is now in abeyance. The undertakings which I have given refute the idoa that the Canal agreement would be the last word. On the contrary, its conclusion and observance would create a favorable channel for further agreements.
81.	It is true that neither Egypt nor Israel would attain its final objective in this interim framework, but Egypt's right to present its claims in the over-all peace negotiations would remain intact, as would Israel's freedom to present its own proposals and reservations.
82.	A second road to peace lies through the resumption of negotiations under Ambassado. Jarring's auspices. Israel agreed to resume these talks in January 1971 despite Egypt's refusal to rectify its violation of the missile- standstill agreement. At a meeting with the Prime Minister and myself in January, Ambassador Jarring was requested to communicate to the Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon a list of principles which, in our view, should be embodied in the peace agreements to be concluded and signed between Israel and each of the Arab Governments concerned. These principles were, at first, vehemently ""ejected by the Egyptian Government. Subsequently, on i 5 February, the Government of Egypt commented f A/8541, annex II] on an aide-memoir submitted a week before by Ambassador Jarring [A/8541, annex I], It did not accept Mr. Jarring's precise formulations on navigation in the Suez Canal, on the Straits of Tiran, nor indeed on the definition of the scope of withdrawal. But the Egyptian reply did contain an expression of readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that all the Egyptian terms for the agreement were met. One of these terms was the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip and all territories beyond the armistice line existing on 4 June 1967.
83.	In its reply on 26 February 1971 [A/8541, annex III] the Israel Government viewed favorably the expression by Egypt of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and reiterated that it was prepared for meaningful negotiation on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.
84.	Why then are the Jarring talks in abeyance? The reason is plain. The Security Council resolution, 242(1967), requires that the withdrawal and boundary clauses of the peace agreement, like all its other provisions, must be determined through agreement, which of course implies negotiation. Egypt declines to hold any dialog or negotiation whatever on this point. It lays down its own position as an ultimate condition to which Israel must submit before negotiation begins. Indeed it is not clear why negotiation would be needed at all if the Egyptian view has to be accepted in advance. In a recent declaration of which President Sadat was a signatory, three Arab Governments, including that of Egypt, reiterated that there can be no negotiation with Israel, no conciliation and no bargaining over the Palestinian issue. This is a more recent and presumably more authoritative statement of Egypt's policy than the one that Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Mr. Jarring six months ago. Together with other declarations in the same mood and spirit, it raises the question whether the February memorandum has the significance that we chose to attach to it at that time.
85.	But on one point alone the February communication from Cairo and the Damascus tripartite statement are one: they both rule out the free, precise and detailed negotiation of the ""boundary and withdrawal questions. Our policy is that, instead of cease-fire lines or armistice lines, we should establish secure, recognized and agreed boundaries as part of the peace-making process, and withdraw our armed forces to those boundaries once they are determined. It is important to break away from the temporary and unresolved territorial concepts which have prevailed since 1948 in order to develop for the first time a permanent structure of boundaries and security agreements.
86.	There is no need to be apologetic about the doctrine that peace boundaries may be different from armistice lines. The Arab Governments wrote into the 1949 Armistice Agreements a provision stating that the armistice lines are not the final boundaries and these must be worked out by agreement in the transition to peace. We are now embarked on that transition. Israel's size and strength are smaller than those of the European Powers which insisted on secure and agreed boundaries after the Second World War; but the right to negotiate boundaries that would release Israel from a chronic and desperate vulnerability belongs to it as to every other sovereign State. In this matter we are not in a position of juridical defense.
87.	I shall summarize under three headings the reasons and justifications which give Israel the right to have negotiation on boundaries and security arrangements. The first, as I have already pointed out, is the provisional character of the lines now held as well as those which existed before. Several years before the 1967 war the Deputy Foreign Minister of Egypt correctly said: ""There is no legal boundary between Israel and Egypt but only a line that was fixed in the pursuance of the Armistice Agreement.""
88.	On 31 May 1967 the representative of Jordan said in the Security Council:
""There is an Armistice Agreement. The Agreement did not fix boundaries; it fixed a demarcation line. The Agreement did not pass judgment on rights political, military or otherwise. Thus I know of no territory; I know of no boundary."" 
89.	A second and more contemporary reason in support of Israel's claim to a negotiation on withdrawal and boundaries lies in the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which has been accepted by some Arab States and by Israel and which is the constitutive document of the Jarring mission. That resolution was adopted after all attempts to require a withdrawal to the 4 June armistice lines had been defeated by vote or discarded for lack of support. The term ""secure and recognized boundaries"" was an innovation in the United Nations vocabulary. It first appeared in a United States draft resolution submitted on 7 November 1967 and later embodied in a United Kingdom draft  which was presented for unanimous vote. I must state with full solemnity and knowledge that Israel's adherence to the Security Council resolution and acceptance of the Jarring mission were secured on the most explicit understanding that the resolution offered an opportunity to negotiate agreements on boundaries and withdrawal. Secretary of State Rogers stated for the United States in October 1969:
""Those boundaries were armistice lines not final political borders. The rights, claims and positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were reserved by the Armistice Agreements. The Security Council resolution neither endorses nor precludes those armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.""
90.	In a public statement on 12 July 1970, Mr. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, declared that he had taken an active part in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). He added:
""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre- June 5 lines. The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""
91.	The United Kingdom Government, which sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967), put itself on record on 17 November 1969, when its Foreign Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, was asked:
""What is the British interpretation of the wording of the 1967 resolution? Does... it... mean that the Israelis should withdraw from all territories taken in the late war? ""
He replied:
""No, Sir. That is not the phrase used in the resolution. The resolution speaks of secure and recognized boundaries. Those words must be read concurrently with the statement on withdrawal."" 
A month later, on 9 December 1969, in the House of Commons he said:
""... There is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""?
I repeat: ""... the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""
92.	It was in the light of these clear undertakings that the Israel Government informed Mr. Jarring in August 1970 that it accepted the Security Council resolution 242 (1967) for implementation in all its parts and that on the establishment of a just and final peace in accordance with the resolution it would withdraw its forces from the cease-fire lines to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the negotiations.
93.	The political and juridical aspects of the questions to which I have referred are the expression^ a deeper, more concrete reality. Israel does not have a policy of expansion or annexation. In the negotiations on boundaries and withdrawals it will seek those modifications which are essential to ensure security and to prevent another war.
94.	ihe war of 1967 did not arise exclusively from the vulnerability of the armistice lines. But there is no doubt that some topographical and strategic situations were a permanent temptation to assault. If they are not corrected and adjusted Israel, on withdrawing from the cease-fire lines, would find itself again in a position of intolerable vulnerability. There could be no more horrifying error than to revert, through lack of precise and detailed negotiation, to a territorial structure and security balance capable of reproducing the peril which exploded four years ago.
95.	In the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai peninsula or even in most of it. But there are vital interests affecting security, peace and navigation which impel us to reserve the right to attempt in the peace negotiations to secure a contractual basis for such continued presence as is necessary to protect security and navigation. There are several juridical expressions and precedents for such an arrangement. Our emphasis is on practical security conditions, not on any particular juridical formula. The post-war map of the world is replete with instructive parallels. The peace treaties in Europe and Asia did not bring about a return to the exact military and territorial dispositions that existed before.
96.	Now Israel does not ask Egypt to accept any of its positions as a condition of negotiation. The proposal for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops to the previous positions is legitimate as an Egyptian proposal. It is equally legitimate for Israel to insist on an opportunity of free negotiation in which its own reservations and counter-proposals could be made. And our request from the world community is modest. We do not present specific Israeli proposals for endorsement by other Governments; we ask only that our right to negotiate the issues vital to our future, to our peace and to our security, should not be cut off in advance.
97.	Our position, then, is this: We have taken note of the Egyptian proposal on withdrawal. Israel would withdraw its armed forces from the Israel-United Arab Republic ceasefire line to the secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in the peace agreement. Now that both parties have presented their basic positions, they should pursue their negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior condition to cover all the points I listed in their respective documents with a view to concluding a peace agreement. I continue to adhere to the view which I expressed at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly in October 1968 that
""It is possible to work out a boundary settlement compatible with the security of Israel and the honor of
Arab States	The majority of the United Nations have
recognized that the only durable and reasonable solutions are agreed solutions serving the common interests of our peoples. The new peace structure in the Middle East, including the secure and recognized boundaries, must be built by Arab and Israeli hands"" [1686th meeting, para. 111].
Thus if Egypt will present its position for negotiation without the unprecedented request for Israel's acceptance of it in advance, we shall be ready for detailed and concrete negotiation on all the matters mentioned in the Egyptian memorandum of 15 February and the Israeli document of 26 February,
98.	Effective and versatile conciliation must include a capacity to move from one direction to another in a tireless pursuit of peace. In March 1968, Ambassador Jarring suggested a formula for the convening of meetings between the parties in Nicosia on the basis of an agreed term of reference. Egypt rejected that proposal. Those concerned with the conciliation effort did not say that the mission had to be held in suspense until Egypt gave a positive reply to something which its policy did not then allow it to endorse. It would be wrong now to affirm that such a vital objective as the establishment of a negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt will never be possible except on the basis of a working paper which did not happen to secure the agreement of the parties. Egyptian-Israeli peace is too great a cause to be tied and tethered for all time to a single optional memorandum. If Egypt will agree to pursue negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior conditions on all the points listed in the Israeli and Egyptian memoranda of February 1971, this road to meaningful negotiation will lie open,
99.	There are other roads to peace. The Suez Canal agreement and the discussion of an over-all settlement are not the only options available for negotiation. The problem of refugees requires a broad acceptance of regional and international responsibility. We have therefore proposed the convening of a conference of Middle Eastern States, together with Governments which have contributed to refugee relief and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in order to chart a five-year plan for the solution of the refugee problem and the integration of refugees into productive life.
100.	This problem would now be considered against the background of some alleviating developments in recent months. There is a growing disillusion with the irredentist pretensions of the terrorist groups and the air pirates. The dividing wall which once prevented all human contact between Israelis and Palestine Arabs is falling. It is true that this is due so far to Israeli initiative. Last year not a single Israeli set foot in any Arab land, but 110,000 Arabs from countries ""at war"" with Israel came into contact with Israel across the open Jordan bridges. An open frontier between Israel and its eastern neighbor similar to the community frontiers in Europe would do much to give human reality to a peace settlement, and indeed might help the settlement to be achieved.
101.	There is a fourth possibility. The problems of boundaries and security are usually considered to be the crux of the negotiation. But there are other unresolved matters in the memoranda presented by Egypt and Israel in February. At first sight there seems to be some proximity between the peace, non-aggression, recognition and navigation clauses suggested by the two Governments. On closer inspection the disparities are substantial, and could become crucial. We suggested in January and later in March that, it might be profitable to attempt to draft some of the clauses of the Egyptian-Israel treaty relating to the principles of peace. It is an accepted negotiating technique to begin with problems in which divergences are less broad and thus to create a favorable atmosphere in which to confront the more acute problems.
102.	There is a fifth road towards negotiating procedure and activity; it concerns the negotiating procedure, but its weight is intensively substantive and not at all procedural I have said that in the early months of 1968 Ambassador Jarring suggested meetings between the parties, under his auspices, in Nicosia, in accordance with a text setting out the terms of reference for the conferences. On 10 March 1968, Ambassador Jarring informed me that Egypt had rejected that proposal. As the Secretary-General's report of 4 January 1971 reveals, Dr. Jarring ""was informed of Israel's official acceptance, without conditions, of the text"". 
103.	Now that was the negative turning-point in the history of the Jarring mission. Since then it has been limited, through Egyptian insistence, to a bizarre procedure under which Israeli documents are presented to Ambassador Jarring, and by him to the Egyptian representative. If the Israel document contains the words ""for communication to the Government of Egypt"", the Egyptian representative refuses to take it into his h?nds; or if he has inadvertently accepted its delivery, he comes back to relinquish it with panic-stricken haste as if it were a hot coal. The Israel document is then divulged by the Egyptian representative to the press, accompanied by a burst of invective. Egyptian replies are published without any hint of an intention to communicate them to Israel. The Egyptian position is that Israel may not talk to Egypt directly, may not talk to Egypt indirectly and may not communicate anything to Egypt in writing.
104.	If no other method is available my Government will communicate its views to Egypt by whatever channel or technique is possible. But we cannot conceal our conviction that there is an element of farce in the idea that the word ""negotiation"" can honestly be applied to the extraordinary procedure followed so far. How can a Government which alleges that it wants a peace agreement with Israel refuse to negotiate the terms of that agreement by a rational method of contact? To say that one is prepared to enter into a peace agreement but not to meet or negotiate even under international chairmanship is to make a mockery of the international community. One thing is clear: No international agreement has been reached on any subject between any States at any time by the methods to which the Jarring mission has so far been confined through Egypt's insistence.
105.	I am convinced that the strongest chance of breaking out of the deadlock lies in a transition to a rational negotiating procedure. The hour is ripe. The gap between the parties is wide, but may not be impossible to bridge. Negotiation is the agent which would transform the potentiality into action.
106.	One of the most important things said about the Middle East in recent days is Sir Alec Douglas-Home's statement yesterday that ""distrust... of this depth ... cannot [easily] be removed by long-distance correspondence"" [1944th meeting, para. 98] and that ""those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog'' [ibid., para, 97], If all those who hold that view would express it with equal candor, an international movement in favor of abandoning the illusion of long- range correspondence would come to effective expression.
107.	There is no weight or value in. the argument that the Arab Governments would be negotiating from weakness if they accepted direct contact under international chairmanship. Their point of reference would be, not the military situation, but the political forum in which the Arab side would speak from a position of numerical and geographical predominance,
108.	I therefore propose to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Riad, that we take our guidance from the spirit which inspires the international life of our ags. Let us meet here this month under the auspices of the United States to discuss the details and! principles of a Suez Canal settlement; or under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jarring to discuss the establishment of peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of our respective memoranda of February 1971. Let us break out of devious procedures and sterile polemics into a new vision and a new hope.
109.	In a recent statement the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, declared that he would sacrifice a million men to achieve a military victory. What he and we should be considering is how to ensure that the 33 million Egyptians, tin 3 million Israelis and the other millions in the Middle East are saved i.om sacrifice and preserved for the construction of a peaceful regional order. The task will not be served by war or by threats of renewed hostilities which command our vigilance but which are, in effect, an echo of ill-fated bombast in the recent past. Nor will our task be fulfilled by living out the rest of 1971 in ineffective debate or inflammatory resolutions. The Arab States may have enough voting strength to secure the adoption of virulent, unbalanced texts or to give a biased interpretation to the Security Council resolution, which would then cease to be an agreed documentary consensus available as a basis for the ultimate and inevitable negotiation. But what will it profit to gain an Assembly majority, but to lose Israel's adherence to a set of principles common to it and to neighboring States? The roads to peace do not have their starting point in war or in polemical debate. They branch out from one of the many avenues and by-ways of negotiation on which we shall meet Egypt when its choice is made and declared.
110.	This session could mark a recuperation in the career of ""the United Nations if the Organization made this the year of negotiation, the year of negotiation in all outstanding disputes. It has other tasks. The Second United Nations Development Decade can be saved from the frustrations of the First if the advanced countries turn aside from the perils of monetary war towards an expanding vocation in the development of emergent societies.
111.	And in the last resort this Organization will be judged according to the role it has played in defense of human welfare and dignity, The call of kinship and of dark memory will bring us to refer at appropriate stages in Committees and in the plenary meetings to two dramas of great intensity and pathos: the Jews of the Soviet Union, of whom some have reached us but of whom the great majority are still restrained from the expression of their cultural identity and their national hope; and the captive remnants of helpless Jews in Arab lands, especially in Syria, whose anguished voice cries out for liberation from terror and despair. This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit. It may be bearing within itself the seed of a universal order in which men will come together to save their environment from pollution, their society from disruption, their economy from decline, their life from the stress and grip of violence. There is no room for fatalistic despair. There is still time for men and nations to be, inspired by a new and spacious vision and to invest their thought and labour in defence of the ""common heritage of mankind"".



"
5,1999,"ISR_post_1998","The fifty-fourth session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations takes place
at a time marking humanity's crossing into the next
millennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain of
tumultuous events that have reshaped the map of the
family of nations.
12


The United Nations was born against the backdrop of
the destruction and desolation of the Second World War,
the most bitter, deadly and inhumane war known to
mankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths of
evil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization and
will be recalled in history as a nightmare in which man
created the devil, who wreaked devastation, destruction,
terror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken by
the Allied forces against the Nazi monster, and the creation
of the United Nations in April 1945, on the verge of the
defeat of the forces of destruction, was an act that marked
the return of humanity to its senses, to salvage the future of
mankind.
In this month when we mark 60 years since the
outbreak of the most horrible of wars, we are strengthened
more than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in the
necessity of the United Nations and of its activities
throughout the world. The various agencies of the United
Nations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; to
supply the needy with food and nourishment; to build
bridges between cultures; to promote education and
overcome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugees
and displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters,
whether natural or man-made.
The soldiers of the United Nations forces are the true
peacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from all
the nations of the world. At times they risk their lives in
areas riddled with conflict and violence around the world,
whether their United Nations mandate is to make peace or
to be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions,
important as they may be to the policy makers and shapers
of international relations, have no meaning to the individual
United Nations soldier, posted far from his country, who
brings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy,
suffering and violence.
After many centuries of violence and war, of
enslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderous
ideologies, after decades of cold war and polarized world
alliances of the East and the West, the human race is now
making great strides down the paths of peace and
reconciliation. Before our very eyes, a process is
enveloping the world, signalling hope for the future.
Mankind is adopting a new path, the path of the prophet
Isaiah, who as far back as 2,600 years ago prophesied that
the day would come when
“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)
This prophecy — which has been adopted by the
United Nations as a source of hope, as the symbol of the
victory of the good in human beings over evil — should
serve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for all
who cherish peace around the world and for their
representatives gathered here today.
The world has become more open. Satellites, the
Internet and telecommunications networks shorten
geographical and cultural distances. The political and
ideological blocs of the past have disintegrated, and the
walls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants and
dictators who built them. They are being replaced by new
blocs, some of which are in the process of being created
where development and prosperity reign. I hope and
believe that these beneficial transformations will also
occur in the Middle East.
In our region, too, the light of hope has been
rekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process,
the objective of which is to reach peace between States
and reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reach
a comprehensive peace with its neighbours, a peace of
harmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merely
political or strategic peace. In our eyes, the absence of
war is not the peace we aspire to achieve.
May I be allowed to emphasize once again that
peace means a culture of peace; peace means no more
threats of violence, whether implied or categorical; peace
entails the end of boycotts, the end of contempt and
defamation, the end of incitement and confrontation...
peace is also a language of peace: it is the way leaders
address their nations, teachers teach their students and
religious leaders inspire their followers.
At a time when various kinds of religious extremism
are rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom and
human freedom, it is essential that inter-faith dialogue be
strengthened and that the religions be manifested in their
enlightened forms, which sanctify tolerance and
coexistence.
On the way to achieving peace in our region, we
often find ourselves confronted with contradictory
realities. Parallel to the political process, our negotiating
partners are conducting a constant political war against
Israel in various international forums, including from the
podium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent
13


with the peace process and is intolerable, as are the extreme
decisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. These
decisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace, as
expressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
We hoped for and expected a different atmosphere,
one that would complement the impetus initiated by the
new Government in Israel. We have been saddened to
witness events that undermine the essence of peace. These
events can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.
Engaging in a peace process, on the one hand, and
maintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions, on the
other, raises some serious concerns about our negotiating
partners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace of
normalization with open borders, or is it only one of
temporary initial recognition? Will our relations with the
Gulf and Maghreb countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia,
Mauritania, Qatar and Oman, be allowed to expand and
develop? Or will these relations remain hostage to mood
swings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations or
whenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts about
these cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light of
the heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking upon
itself in this process.
Three weeks ago, on 4 September, Israel and the
Palestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum, which for the first time creates a direct,
chronological, political and conceptual link between the
Interim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13
September, the final status talks were renewed between
Israelis and Palestinians.
We are determined to reach a framework agreement
that will form the basis of the final status agreement by
February 2000, as stated and agreed upon in the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will select
the issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.
The topics at hand are known, as are the differing vantage
points and positions of each side. The differences can be
resolved only by direct negotiations.
Regarding the final status, I wish to affirm from this
podium that when we refer to political separation as one of
the prime concepts of the permanent settlement, we are also
saying that, for the benefit of both sides, we should not
necessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in the
various spheres of living.
From Israel’s perspective, there is no competition and
never has been any between the different negotiating tracks.
Israel also aspires to reach peace with Syria, our
neighbour to the north. This is, after all, in the higher
common interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r ,
along with these common interests, the following point
must be made clear: A democratic country like Israel
cannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks that
requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as
dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the
opposing side.
We must maintain the momentum of good will so
that we can face our children, Syrian and Israeli alike,
with a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:
We tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon the
leaders of Syria, in view of what we have gone through
together, to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetings
and discussion are not political sacrifices — they are
basic necessities.
On the road to a comprehensive peace, we wish to
see Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomaly
which has developed in its territory must come to an end.
We have never had nor do we have now any territorial
claims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and only
interest is to guarantee the safety and security of our
citizens. I must say that, regrettably, the Government of
Lebanon has for many years failed to enforce its
sovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarm
Hezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and that
Israel, within the framework of an agreement, will be able
to leave the southern part of Lebanon.
Nevertheless, with that as our ambition, I wish to
emphasize that we will not be held hostage much longer
on this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We will
make our own independent decisions, as we see fit, in
order to ensure our protection and our vital interests,
taking all options under consideration.
A reconciliation between Israel and its neighbours
must extend the promise that all the peoples of the region
may reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must not
be viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcome
of peaceful coexistence, normalization is not in the
service of one particular party. It is in the interests of all
the nations of the region.
We hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early as
this year. There is a need for close cooperation in
regional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendous
potential. In order to fully realize this potential, we must
establish a mechanism of true cooperation among the
14


States of the region. This cooperation would clearly be to
the benefit of all of us in the region.
The scarcity of water in our region, which will only
get worse, may impose a new way of life on the inhabitants
of the Middle East in the coming years. Israel is
anticipating this problem and preparing for it, but in this
case, as in others, cooperation in the region is essential and
will benefit all sides.
The working groups of the multilateral tracks
undertook various assignments of primary importance.
Unfortunately, their activities have been frozen for
irrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Any
delay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peace
process and delay the aid packages so essential to the
peoples of the region. Throughout this important process,
on the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike, we are
accompanied by the international community. First and
foremost was the United States of America, along with the
Russian Federation, the European Union, Canada, Norway,
Japan, China and other countries and organizations that
have assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributions
earn them special commendation from this rostrum.
Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking
down the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in our
region. Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as
renewing the multilateral tracks, are essential to furthering
the common objectives of the nations in our region. T h e
relations between Israel and Jordan are an example of
appropriate and favourable relations between neighbouring
countries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations
between the two nations in the economic, social and
political realms.
As we march further along the difficult path of
making peace, we look back with sorrow and sadness as we
remember the pioneers who broke new ground and are no
longer with us today: the late Menachem Begin, Anwar
Saddat, Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein and King Hassan II
of Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us to
continue to work towards completing their enterprise of
peacemaking.
We cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region is
neither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiate
the peace process, we remain aware of the threats and
dangers directed against us, threatening the stability of the
entire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism, on the
one hand, and of the potential use of weapons of mass
destruction, on the other, threatens the peace, stability and
future of the entire region. This threat is not just an
element of academic debates in the study of international
relations, but a harsh reality which we must all face.
From this international platform, I call for a halt to
all technological, scientific and other kinds of assistance
to countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons,
while threatening the existence of the State of Israel and
the region as a whole.
The Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadership
lacking reason and stability poses a threat to all the
countries in the region and to the world at large. The
monitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must be
immediately resumed. That is the obligation of the
international community so long as the Iraqi regime seeks
non-conventional weapons and threatens the region. The
United Nations is the largest, most authoritative and most
recognized international body. It should therefore be the
one to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbing
this danger.
Terrorism is an additional strategic enemy and we
cannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat not
only to Israel, but to many other nations across the world
as well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. There
can be no coexistence with terror, either in the context of
the negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours,
or in the broader regional context. Anyone who believes
that terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated is
mistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. A
synthesized, coordinated and unrelenting approach must
be adopted against it.
Here, in this building of stone and glass, reflecting
the current image of our world today with its points of
light and shadows of darkness, counterparts and enemies
meet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum for
discussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way to
resolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogue
and common language are the tools of diplomacy, the raw
material for the creation of a new reality and the
foundation for a stable and safer society.
It was here in the General Assembly, at the
beginning of the decade, that I first met with my Chinese
counterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation between
our two countries, we endeavoured to re-establish
diplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was also
here that we laid the groundwork for establishing ties
with the former Soviet Union, as well as with India,
Nigeria and other States. These are only a few examples
15


demonstrating the possibility in this arena for building a
bridge between nations and States.
As a nation that experienced great difficulties,
overcome only by accelerated development efforts, the State
of Israel takes part in the international effort to aid others
and share knowledge, experience and technology,
experience which it has accumulated in various fields. The
nation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharing
and identifying with the world at large.
Through the Division for International Cooperation
within the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel maintains ongoing
projects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. We
have demonstration units and we are conducting research.
For example, a special medical centre was recently
established in Mauritania and serves the many citizens of
that State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly,
Israel invests great efforts and resources in training
professionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary for
meeting the various challenges that engage many parts of
the world.
In the more than 40 years since its inception, the
Division for International Cooperation has trained more
than 70,000 trainees from more than 120 countries, who
have come to Israel and attended its training courses in the
areas of agriculture, water resources, health and medicine,
science, education and others.
In 1998 alone, some 155 courses were held in Israel
on a variety of topics, with the participation of more than
4,000 trainees. Gladly, I can report that many of the
trainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820
Palestinians participated in these courses over the past year,
thereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace which
have been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In the
same year, Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60
different countries, with the participation of over 7,000
trainees. I am proud to point out that in many of the
countries to which we sent Israeli experts, the local
personnel managed to translate our goodwill into positive
results on the ground, to the benefit of their people and
their land.
Because of the reputation it has acquired, the Division
for International Cooperation is also one of the central
addresses in Israel to which people can turn in times of
disaster around the world. We have recently witnessed just
how essential such assistance can be in times of natural
disasters. Israel has always responded favourably to
requests for aid and relief, regardless of the political
context or the state of diplomatic relations.
We wish to support and commend the United States
of America, our friend and ally, an inspiration to us all in
its efforts to promote the values of cooperation among
nations. This is also the time to express our appreciation
to the United States for its intensive efforts to bring true
peace to the Middle East.
Even today in the United States we have witnessed
again a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case at
hand is the threat to declare a boycott against the
American company Disney, because the company dared
to allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibition
celebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats and
the use by certain Arab States of this anachronistic
device. It has no place here or anywhere else in the
world.
Over thousands of years, since the time of biblical
King David, the builder of Jerusalem, until the present
day, Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any other
nation in the world besides the nation of Israel, the
Jewish people. Even after our forced exile from the land
of Israel, we continued, generation after generation, to
stay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem was
carried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.
In our wanderings, in the East and in the West, in
the African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia, from
the golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition,
during the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to the
charred ashes of the Holocaust, throughout all the above
the eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directed
toward Jerusalem. Year after year, from father to son, the
anthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been “Next
Year in Jerusalem”.
With the passing of those previous generations and
exiles, we have had the privilege of being deemed worthy
to return to Jerusalem, to rebuild the ruins, to rededicate
the city as a centre radiating with beauty, open to all
followers of all religions, as the poet has said, where
freedom of all religions is a fact of life.
It is so upsetting then that even today, 51 years since
the independence of the State of Israel, there are still
those who would deny our natural right to decide the
location of our capital, a natural right given to every
nation in the world. From Jerusalem, the city of David, I
will quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem,
16


in words which transcends the limits of time and retains
their meaning in every generation:
“Our feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmly
together.” (The Holy Bible, Psalm 122:2-3)
Today, as before, from this podium we declare to the
entire world, to our friends and people and those who are
distant from us: Jerusalem, unified under Israeli
sovereignty, is and will remain forever the capital of Israel.

"
5,1979,"ISR_prev_1998","161.	Mr, President, please accept my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide the work of the Assembly efficiently and fairly.
162.	I would also like to express our appreciation to the President of the last session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Lievano of Colombia.
163.	It is my pleasure to congratulate Saint Lucia on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
164.	As we reflect on the development of the United Nations throughout the past year, we find the spectacle far from encouraging. The fundamental obstacle to the Organization's work is the selectivity which has been forced upon it by an automatic majority of the membership, which is far from impartial and prefers expediency to principles. The United Nations specialized agencies have suffered badly from this. Organs like UNESCO, WHO, the ILO and others have been severely affected by heavy politicization which has influenced their functioning. Instead of dedicating themselves solely to their specific fields in the service of mankind, they have been reduced to forums of political one-sidedness.
165.	There must be a return to the United Nations Charter. Consultation and agreement should be restored to their primary place. In particular, the specialized agencies must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they have been dragged, so that they may devote themselves to the economic, social, humanitarian, scientific and technological tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform so well when permitted to do so.
166.	There has been little improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Even though the number of exit visas for Soviet Jews has increased recently, the gap between the number of Jews applying for exit visas and those granted them is growing, while an even larger number of Soviet Jews have been denied the fundamental right to emigrate—a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki Declaration. Those Jews who do insist on their rights are subjected to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment and, in some cases, to arrest and imprisonment. We have taken note of the fact that seven Jewish prisoners were released a few months ago. However, we are particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences imposed on other Jews whose only crime is their desire to re-join their families in Israel—Iosif Begun, Boris Kalendarov, Iosif Mendelevich, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Simon Shnirman, Vladimir Slepak, Aleksandr Vilic and Amner Zavurov. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and permit everyone who seeks to emigrate to Israel and join his people and his family to do so.
167.	We cannot be silent in the face of the rising incitement against the State of Israel and the Jewish people, its religion, culture and national movement, as manifested day by day in the official Soviet media. In this regard, it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their religion and culture. We appeal to the Soviet Union to allow Jewish religion and culture to be practised and expressed freely, and to put an end to anti-Jewish propaganda.
168.	We also deeply regret that the Government of Syria continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and to be reunited with their relatives living in other lands. We appeal to the Syrian Government to change this policy.
169.	The past year witnessed a historic break-through in the Middle East. In March, Israel and Egypt signed the first ever Israel-Arab peace treaty. President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel concluded that Treaty after intense negotiations, which lasted a year and a half and which demanded great leadership and courage. Israel wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States of America and to its President, Mr. Jimmy Carter, personally for the vital role which they played in bringing about this historic achievement, which has created a new reality in our region.
170.	Let me recall here that Israel has throughout the first 30 years of its independence constantly extended its hand to its neighbours in the search for peace. This found expression on the very first day of the establishment of our State, in the Israel Declaration of Independence of 14 May 1948. Let me add specifically that as early as in the summer of 1967, very shortly after the six-day war, Israel had taken the initiative and offered to sign a treaty of peace with Egypt, declaring its readiness to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egyptian sovereignty in the context of a peace treaty. This Israeli proposal was rejected, and the answer given by Egypt at the time was: ""No negotiation, no recognition and no peace with Israel: what was taken by force will be taken back by force."" This year, however, has seen the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. After a generation of continued warfare, the realization of a dream begins.
171.	The Treaty of Peace, which, as stated in its preamble, is ""an important step in the search for comprehensive peace in the area,"" has provided for a role in its implementation to be fulfilled by the United Nations. United Nations forces and observers were called upon to carry out functions in order to see that the peace treaty was fully implemented. Ironically and paradoxically, that initiative taken by some States Members of the United Nations in the cause of peace was rejected by the United Nations. The Security Council was exposed to the threat of a Soviet veto, and the mandate of UNEF was not renewed, so that the Security Council in effect disassociated itself from the first positive and major step in the great effort to relieve the Middle East from the dangers of war.
172.	Although our assumption and hope that the United Nations would assist in the implementation of the Treaty of Peace have been disappointed, we will proceed along the path of peace. The attitude of the United Nations will not damage the peace process; but it will, no doubt, lower the prestige and even the moral stature of the United Nations, one of whose basic principles and purposes is, as stated by the Charter, to ""maintain international peace and security . . . and to bring about by peaceful means . . . settlement of international disputes. . . ''.
173.	As a result of the Treaty of Peace, the process of normalization in the relations between Egypt and Israel has already begun. We are confident that in the months ahead we shall make further progress in cementing new bonds of co-operation.
174.	The frequent visits and meetings of the leaders of both countries are also an expression of the common desire to promote understanding and closer personal relationships. The most recent—and most impressive—visit of President El-Sadat to Israel three weeks ago and the reception given him in the city of Haifa, where Jews and Arabs coexist in harmony and cooperation, indicated the deep feelings of all the population of Israel towards the era of peace and, we hope, left warm memories in the minds and hearts of our Egyptian guests.
175.	Over the past year the situation in Lebanon has become grave. The intervention of Syria has, in fact, plunged the northern part of that formerly prosperous country into a state of anarchy, and the Lebanese Government has become incapable of ruling and exercising its authority over all of its territory. The southern part of Lebanon has been, to a great extent, in the hands of the terrorist groups of the PLO, whose murderous activities have been a source of danger and harassment not only to Israel, but also to the Christian and Moslem Lebanese in that area.
176.	UNIFIL was established by Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978.
177.	Israel, having been compelled to act militarily against the PLO in southern Lebanon in a clear act of self-defence, agreed to withdraw its forces, provided that the new United Nations force would undertake to restore peace and security in the area and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the country.
178.	Unfortunately, the aim of restoring Lebanon's integrity has not been achieved, and the Lebanese Government is still incapable of exercising its sovereignty. PLO terrorist groups are still functioning all over Lebanon and, in quite a large number of cases, inside the area of United Nations units. In this region, which was free from any terrorist presence at the time of the Israeli withdrawal, there are now about 700 PLO terrorists, who are acting murderously through the lines of the United Nations Force against the people of Israel. The Force was supposed to act against this. The Secretary-General, in his initial report of 19 March 1978 spoke of the right of self-defence of the Force, including resistance by forceful means to attempts to prevent it from discharging its duties.
179.	In his report of 13 September 1978, the Secretary-General stated, among the guidelines and terms of reference of UNIFIL, that ""uniformed or armed personnel and military equipment are not allowed to enter the UNIFIL area of operation""."" However, there are too many cases in which the Force has in fact reconciled itself to the presence and activities of the terrorists in its own area. UNIFIL has not carried out its mandate and duties in this respect, despite the fact that its units have themselves suffered from terrorist activities and at least eight UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in these incidents. The presence and activities of the PLO terrorist groups in the region are in violation of the UNIFIL mandate, and it should be understood that Israel cannot be expected to sit back while terror is being unleashed against its population, no matter where in Lebanon these actions originate.
180- Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries ceased to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. No cause can justify terrorism. The issue is, therefore, a fundamental one for the international community, and the struggle against terrorism should continue until terrorism has been brought to an end.
181.	The PLO, by its very nature and actions, is a terrorist organization. Its true character is reflected in its so-called' 'Covenant"", which calls for the purging of the Zionist presence from Palestine. The same document denies the existence of the Jewish people and its unbroken historical ties with the land of Israel. It alleges that the establishment of the State of Israel is null and void and rejects outright any plans to settle the Middle East conflict by peaceful means.
182.	The PLO has not hesitated to try to translate its vicious doctrine into criminal deeds. It has conducted an unceasing campaign of terror aimed at the mass murder of innocent civilians in Israel. From June 1967 to date, over 640 people have been murdered and 3,300 others have been wounded in Israel by the PLO. It has also terrorized and intimidated Arabs prepared to negotiate peace with Israel, killing more than 350 Arabs and injuring almost 2,000 others.
183.	Given the PLO's character and aims, it was, in fact, recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process. No country can or should be expected to negotiate with a party which denies its very existence, aims at its destruction, and uses terror against its civilian population. On the other hand, careful provision was made in the Camp David agreements to include Palestinian Arab residents of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District in the peace process.
184.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East, Agreed at Camp David by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel, and witnessed by the President of the United States of America, refers positively and constructively to Palestinian Arab rights, as well as to the rights and security interests of the other parties. It is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which are the only agreed basis for peace negotiations in the Middle East. Any tampering with them can only gravely jeopardize the current peace process.
185.	This Framework agreement sees the solution of the question of the Palestinian Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District in terms of granting them full autonomy, for a transitional period of five years, before reaching an agreement on the final status of the area. For that reason, it was agreed to negotiate on a principle of self-government—exercised through an administrative council—for the Arab inhabitants of the areas in question.
186.	Moreover, in the preamble to this Framework, the signatories invited other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere to it as well. In the letter sent by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel to President Carter on 26 March 1979—the date of the signing of the peace treaty—they invited the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Join the negotiations.
187.	This Framework provides for negotiations on the transitional period of five years, and also for the subsequent negotiations on a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, in which the location of the boundaries dividing the two countries will be agreed. The option of creating a third State between Israel and Jordan is, therefore, not considered in the Camp David agreements.
188.	Thus, the objective of the negotiations being held now, based on the Camp David Framework, is the provision of full autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. The Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants. This Framework also specifies measures that will be taken to assure the security of Israel and its neighbours.
189.	The only way to keep the process of peace going on is for us to adhere strictly to the Camp David agreements in their letter and spirit, and I should like to assure this Assembly that this is the policy of Israel.
190.	Before concluding, let me say a few words about Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people.
191.	Jerusalem has known many foreign rulers during the course of its long history, but none of them regarded it as their capital. Only the Jewish people has always maintained it as the sole centre of its national and spiritual life. For thousands of years, Jews have prayed daily for their return to Jerusalem and, for the past century and a half, Jerusalem has had a continuous and uninterrupted Jewish majority.
192.	Jerusalem cannot be divided again by barbed wire and there can be no return to the repeated shooting at our civilians and the barbaric desecration of the Jewish quarter of the City, the Holy Places and cemeteries, as happened before 1967, when the eastern part of Jerusalem was under the occupation of Jordan. It is relevant to recall that, in grave violation of the 1949 Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement; Jordan prevented Jews from having access to their Holy Places and cultural institutions and tried to eliminate systematically every trace of Jerusalem's Jewish past. By contrast, as a result of Israel's policy of free access to all Holy Places, millions of Moslem and Christian tourists and pilgrims—in addition to Jewish visitors—have come to Jerusalem since 1967, and have prayed and worshipped freely at its mosques and churches.
193.	Jerusalem is now a city of coexistence between Jews and Arabs. At the same time, the Government of Israel is and has always been conscious of the fact that Jerusalem is of deep concern also to other faiths, and that its religious and cultural sites are precious to Christians and Moslems, as well as to Jews. There should be completely free access to all the holy shrines by believers of all religions, without any exception, completely protected and guaranteed by the law of the country, and those holy shrines should be administered by the respective representatives of the religions concerned, without any interference.
194.	The choice before the United Nations is clear. This Organization, whose Charter enjoins it to support the cause of international peace and security, must not submit to the designs of those who reject peace. Let the United Nations give peace its full support. Let the Governments of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judaea, Samaria and Gaza join the negotiations in order to achieve the noble goal of a real and durable comprehensive peace in our area."
5,1980,"ISR_prev_1998","Mr. President, at the outset I should like to express to you our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and the outstanding qualities that you have exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy ensure your ability to keep a firm grasp on the helm of the Assembly during this stormy period.
53.	Al the opening of this session a new State joined the ranks of the United Nations: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I should like to welcome it to the Organization and wish it all prosperity and success as an independent and sovereign Stale.
54,	To my very grout regret, it is not possible to express satisfaction at the condition of the United Nations today, cither in general or from the specific perspective of my country. Indeed, it is questionable whether there remains much similarity or correlation between the noble ideals, principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the United Nations and the reality prevailing in the Organization today. The founders of this Organization saw in their vision a forum and a framework for the achievement and maintenance of peace between nations after the horrific experience of the Second World War, a horror which they had experienced at first hand.
55.	Perhaps the most cynical expression of the gap between the original vision and the reality prevailing in the United Nations today has been the refusal of this Organization, ostensibly dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to adopt and encourage the Camp David accords' and the subsequent Peace Treaty, which brought to an end decades of hostilities between Israel and Egypt and raised the possibility of expanding the peace process to embrace all of Israel's neighbours. This Organization, whose principal purpose is the promotion of peace among nations, has thus betrayed its own raison d'etre by rejecting an historic step towards peace and by playing into the hands of the enemies of peace, the rejectionists and the warmongers.
56. This unhappy phenomenon is not confined to the General Assembly. Out of the 18 debates which have been conducted thus far during 1980 in the Security Council, nine were devoted to subjects involving my country. Is there anyone who seriously believes that half of the world's international problems today are connected with Israel? We need only glance at a map of our region, the Middle East—which is just one region of the world—to sec that it is riddled from length to breadth with countless conflicts between States, between ethnic minorities and between different religious groups. Virtually all those conflicts have a history and a dynamic of their own, totally divorced from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
57. By way of illustration. I need only mention the situation in Afghanistan and. of course, the full-scale war between Iran and Iraq—a worrying outbreak of hostilities which has wide-ranging implications. That war between two States ruled by extremist, irresponsible and trigger-happy regimes threatens both regional and international security by putting at risk much of the world's regular supply of oil, That war, a struggle between two Moslem States, demolishes, in our opinion, the naive and groundless belief that the world's oil supply is dependent on a pro-Arab solution to the dispute between Israel and its neighbours. It has become all too clear that the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will not provide any miracle cure for the region as a whole or eliminate the many other grave conflicts raging in it. The ability of the United Nations to work for an end to the bloodshed in Iraq and Iran will be a yardstick of the Organization's ability to continue to fulfil its role for the encouragement and maintenance of peace.
58.	Important tasks have been allotted to the United Nations. Besides its role in the preservation of international peace and security, it also has a vital role to play in other spheres which require our earnest attention, in particular through the specialized agencies established for various purposes. But even the specialized agencies have been gravely compromised by the plague of politicization. Business-like debates and deliberations in them have become increasingly difficult—if not all but impossible to conduct—to the grave detriment not only of the agencies themselves but also of those whom they were set up to serve.
59.	While I am bound to express deep regret at the condition of the United Nations today. I must also express the hope that all Members of the Organization which share our concern and feelings of responsibility for its future will intensify their efforts both to bring the United Nations back to the ideals of its founders and to channel the specialized agencies back to their specific areas of concern.
60.	Among the subjects which have rightly been given a prominent place in the agenda of the United Nations are the state of the world's economy and the relations between the industrialized and the developing nations. The convening of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly attests to this fact. Israel took part in that special session with the intention of making a constructive contribution to its work. We therefore share the disappointment over the results of that event, which were not adequate. We sincerely hope that in the near future the efforts to have a constructive dialogue rather than confrontation will be resumed, so that those whose needs are greatest will not suffer the most.
61.	Despite our small size and limited resources, we have for decades devoted far greater efforts than might have been expected to assisting nations of the third world in the development of their economies and societies. Israel has shared freely the know-how which it has developed, as well as its experience as a small State in an arid and subtropical region, which has enabled us to make great strides over a period of a few short years.
62.	The problems encountered by Israel in the course of its social and economic development are similar to the problems facing much of the developing world today. Many of the solutions worked out in Israel can be applied directly by others. Despite the disappointments which my country has experienced, Israel continues to have deep sympathy for the struggle of the developing countries to ameliorate and advance the condition of their peoples and economies. Israel stands ready to continue to give of its know-how and to take a vigorous and constructive part in the efforts of the international community in the spheres of health, social services, agriculture, development of new and renewable sources of energy, and in every other sphere to which we can contribute.
63.	From this rostrum I should like to give expression to the anguish of our Jewish brothers in various parts of the globe. There is. it would seem, no end to the pain of the Jew in history. The suffering and persecution continue even today. And we, the people of Israel, feel responsible for the lot of every Jew who suffers anywhere.
64.	In the last year additional harsh limitations have been imposed on Jews who seek to leave the Soviet Union and emigrate to the State of Israel. Those restrictions conflict with the most basic human and national rights of peoples, and we are in duty bound to echo the cries of the Jews in the Soviet Union and appeal to the Government of that country to remove the restrictions and facilitate the immigration of Jews to Israel.
65.	We must also express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed, and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic-human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds as hostages and which it prevents from leaving.
66.	The Jews of Iran have suffered painfully in recent months, and their situation is deteriorating from day to day. Many Jews have been thrown in gaol; others have been given the death sentence, in most cases on ""charges"" of contact with Israel. We know of the difficulties in dealing with the present regime in Iran, to which fundamental concepts of human rights and the norms of international relations seem foreign. But we hope that sight will not be lost of the situation of the Jews there who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of the minorities in that troubled land.
67.	Two years ago a development took place in the Middle East—a breakthrough which can appropriately be called historic. After serious negotiations between the parties, with the active and important participation of the United States, the Camp David framework and the subsequent Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty were signed by the leaders of the two countries and witnessed by the President of the United States. Israel made major concessions and took considerable risks by signing those agreements, l.et me cite only our withdrawal from the oilfields in Sinai, for there is no need for me to waste words on the significance and implications of that step in this day and age. Similarly I need only point to the strategic depth in Sinai which Israel has relinquished, as well as to the advanced air bases located in Sinai, the evacuation of which will be implemented in due course in accordance with the terms of the Peace Treaty.
68.	Israel believed that its concessions and sacrifices would be met with appreciation and understanding by the world community and that a long-awaited breakthrough would be achieved on the international scene. Not only has that not 06itte about, but many countries in the world have spared no effort to destroy that hard-won peace, and Israel continues to be the object of unending accusations and attacks.
69.	Nevertheless, the decision and determination of Israel remain firm to continue on the road to peace. Thus, in accordance with the Camp David framework, negotiations have taken place for the attainment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea. Samaria and the Gaza District.
70.	Substantial progress has been achieved in these talks in certain fields, but the talks have, it is true, had their tips and downs and have even been suspended a number of times by Egypt. There is nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the difficulties encountered thus far in the progress of the talks. They reflect the complexities inherent in the subjects under discussion. The difficulties are familiar to any country which, at one time or another, has been engaged in complex negotiations involving multifaceted and long-standing problems.
71.	One area in which progress has been achieved in the negotiations is the modalities of the free elections to be held in the territories concerned. These procedures would make the proposed autonomy into one of the few—all too few— examples of free democratic process in the Middle East. Progress has also been achieved in the area of powers and responsibilities of the autonomy covering many aspects of the everyday life of the inhabitants of the territories in question.
72.	We certainly believe that autonomy can and must be established. All the parties to the Camp David framework are convinced that the process set out in that framework is the only one which is within the realm of the possible. All alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem at hand—ideas such as the holding of an international conference or the like—are devoid of real prospect or purpose. No one can really believe that the various elements in the Middle East which arc so much at odds with each other would attend a peace conference and achieve a positive outcome that would lead to a solution acceptable to all. Thus too the ideas entertained by the European Community, which do not take Israel's position into account, are only likely to encourage those who are opposed to peace.
73.	Those who genuinely seek peace should encourage the progress which has been achieved through the Camp David process. Let them also bear in mind and give due regard to the fact that, by proposing the idea of autonomy in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, Israel has taken on itself great risks for the sake of peace.
74.	We hope that the autonomy talks will be resumed in the near future. We also hope that the process of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt will be intensified and will serve as the best possible proof and a living symbol of the fact that peace can and must take the place of war. The full significance of these peaceful relations should be grasped for what they are—and for what they may lead to—as the very corner-stone for peace in the region.
75. The leaders of Israel and Egypt have reiterated time and again their mutual commitment to the proposition that there will be no more war. Let us hope that the change which has come about in the Middle East with the signing of peace will be the opening for a positive and long-lasting transformation in the history of our conflict-ridden area. The strict adherence to the agreements by Israel, in accordance with their letter and spirit alike, is a guarantee of the continuation of the peace process. However, by itself it is not enough. We hope that all the others involved will act in the same way.
76. Much has been alleged against Israel in the name of the principle of self-determination for nations. We favour that concept, and we have proved that in the support that we extended to many States which have achieved their independence in our generation, in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. The Governments of those States and their peoples know that full well. But there is no connection between that principle and the perverted attempt to turn self-determination into the basis for the destruction of the Stale of Israel, as certain States are endeavouring to do. Anyone who is familiar with the ideology and the terminology of the murder organization that calls itself the PLO, as well as with the declarations of the various Arab rejectionist States, can see beyond all doubt that the term ""self-determination"", as they use it, is nothing more than a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.
77.	It should not be forgotten that the Palestinian Arabs have achieved their self-determination in Jordan, a State which is the Arab State in Palestine, by virtue of its history, territory, population, culture and all aspects of its national life. The establishment of a second Palestinian Arab Slate by distorting the principle of self-determination means the creation of an extremist and hostile base opposed to the very-existence of Israel. Hence we will not agree to a distorted form of self-determination, which in reality implies self-destruction for our ancient nation deeply rooted in its own land.
78.	The programme of autonomy which we have proposed for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, as accepted in principle in the Camp David frameworks, is the first practical proposal to be advanced to provide a dignified solution for the needs of the Arab population of those areas. It comes in place of all the empty declarations with which the Palestinian Arabs concerned have deluded themselves and have been deluded by other States and organizations over the years.
79.	One of the most vivid expressions of the rejection of all peace proposals by the Arab rejectionist States is to be seen in their unprecedented military build-up and in the armaments which they have received in recent years from the Soviet bloc or purchased from the United States and Western Europe. In the course of the last three years, orders for arms purchases by the larger Arab States have reached astronomic sums. The quantities of arms that were actually supplied have been equally staggering. There is no precedent for the amassing of arms on this scale in our region. Those arms are designated first and foremost for use against Israel. But the implications of that vast array of armaments ait not confined to my country alone. It also serves to inject war into the area at large.
80.	We call upon the United Nations to take due note of the military build-up by the Arab rejectionist States and to urge them to decrease their armament. For our part, we are prepared to lend a hand in any joint effort to bring about the limitation of arms in our region which is poised on top of a volcano.
81. I should like to address myself to another crucial aspect of disarmament. Israel has consistently supported resolutions of the General Assembly aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This global problem, we believe, can best be solved by means of negotiated regional arrangements. Hence, since 1975, Israel has consistently advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East on the Tlatelolco model. Israel believes that an international conference of all the Slates in the region and adjacent to our region should be held, leading to the conclusion of a formal, contractual, multilateral convention among all States of the region.
82.	We hope that in the course of this General Assembly, we shall find a suitable opportunity to give concrete expression to our views on this matter. In the meantime, I should like to reiterate my Government's position, which is that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israeli dispute.
83.	In the last months, Jerusalem has been the object of attacks on Israel in various international forums. There has been much hypocrisy and cynicism in those attacks, For, truth to tell, never has the situation of the various religions represented in Jerusalem been better than that prevailing since the unification of the city by Israel in 1967. For 19 years, between 1948 and 1967, the eastern part of the city was under Jordanian occupation and barbed wire divided it in two. Places holy to the Jews were maliciously desecrated. Ancient synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed in a barbaric manner, and Jews were denied access to the Holy Places which are the spiritual life-blood of the Jewish people. It is not out of place to remark that the Moslem Arab citizens of Israel were also denied access to their Holy Places during that ignoble period. And where, I am bound to ask, was the voice of this Organization during that period"".' Not once was it raised in condemnation of those illegal acts.
84.	On the other hand, since 1967. all—irrespective of religion and nationality—have been accorded free access to the city of Jerusalem and the possibility of worshipping at the Holy Places and shrines revered by them. Israel has assured the free and unfettered observance of the religious rites of all members of all faiths, who also administer their religious lives and their Holy Places without any outside interference. That is the truth well known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to everyone who has visited the city. There is no substance or basis to any claim to the contrary.
85.	There is no need for me to dwell at length on the bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem. The Jewish people is the only people which has made Jerusalem its capital since it appeared as a nation on the stage of human history. Throughout the many years of exile inflicted on it. The Jewish people prayed three times a day, every day, for its restoration to Jerusalem.
86. For the last 150 years there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Whoever seeks to sever Jerusalem from Israel seeks to decapitate the Jewish people. We hope that nations that seek peace and know the reality which prevails in Jerusalem today will respect the city as the sovereign capital of Israel; a city which will not be divided again, in the same way as Israel respects the Holy Places of all religions and their freedoms in the city.
87.	I wish to conclude with a call in the spirit of the Prophets of Israel, who were a light and an inspiration for much of mankind. My call is for peace—peace which is at the very basis of the existence of the United Nations.
88.	We in Israel yearn for peace. We have done so since the first day of the restoration of our national sovereignty—in our Declaration of Independence, which was issued on the very day that the State of Israel was founded in 1948. In that Declaration, we extend the hand of peace and good neighbourliness to all the States around us and all their peoples. We have taken far-reaching steps and have made huge sacrifices for the sake of peace. But peace with Israel does not mean peace without Israel, or peace at its expense. Nor does it mean peace with a weak Israel deprived of its capital and with its wings clipped from the security and geostrategic viewpoints. With such an Israel peace will not be attained, because a weak Israel will be an object of unceasing attacks and destructive designs.
89.	I wish to call upon the Arab States which are our neighbours, and also upon the Palestinian Arabs living in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, to follow the dictates of reason and to join the peace process. I wish to call upon the other nations of the world to support this course and to prevail upon the Arab States to adopt it. The world at large, and not merely our region alone, will benefit from this.
"
5,1986,"ISR_prev_1998","This session of the Assembly opens the fifth decade of the United Nations. I hope that it will begin an era in which this body will come closer to realizing the dreams of its founding fathers.
Their ideals were inspired and inspiring: safeguarding the principles of universality and equality, a genuine desire to maintain international peace and security, encouraging international cooperation in solving global problems and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Unfortunately, those lofty principles have been vitiated and perverted beyond recognition. Extremists have seized this body. They have compelled it to shun the only peace treaty in the Middle East - the Camp David Accords. They have forced upon it an annual ritual of adopting dozens of distorted and irrelevant resolutions relating to my country. In clinging to these barren exercises, the United Nations spends precious time and funds, resources that could profitably be used to combat
hunger and poverty.
These and other issues remain unresolved, however, and they demand serious and responsible attention. First among them is the repugnant reign of apartheid in South Africa.
Israel, founded upon basic moral and democratic values, cannot remain silent in the face of racial discrimination, wherever it nay occur.. We reject and condemn apartheid as a political, social and economic system. Israel also believes that violence is not the path to reform in South Africa. We must urgently foster a climate that will facilitate a political settlement if we are to avoid a further drift towards economic chaos, suffering and bloodshed. We hope responsible leaders on all sides will act to create such a climate and that the Government of South Africa will initiate negotiations that will satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of all South Africans, regardless of race or color.

In the heart of the African continent many continue to suffer from hunger, disease and poverty. There is a growing awareness around the world of the need to provide help. People must be fed right now. We have contributed to that effort, but we also believe that we must help countries afflicted by hunger to develop the long-term means to prevent its recurrence and to set their economies on the road to development and growth.
This past year the General Assembly convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The Organization of African unity (OAU) has outlined a development strategy that is reminiscent of Israel's own development experience. Israel announced at that special session its readiness to make immediate contributions to the attainment of those goals. We offered to share our experience in agriculture and desertification, in medicine and education and in the general field of economic development. Many in Africa remember our earlier contributions in this field. Our experience has been gained in 28 years of assistance by Israel to more than 100 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We have trained over 55,000 professionals from developing countries. We have shared our experience with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. And we are ready and willing to do more.
Many of those African States that severed relations with Israel in 1973 and 1974 are now in the process of resuming those relations. I wish to commend the leadership and courage of the Heads of State who have gone on to re-establish formal diplomatic ties with us despite the pressures exerted upon them. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all African nations and we expect many more countries to resume full diplomatic relations with Israel in the near future.
The Middle East, with its vast resources of land and minerals, has within it the potential to leap into a new age in the twenty-first century - an age of great economic prosperity and a better life for millions. But that hope hangs on the outcome of a precarious contest between those who seek progress and those who continually plunge the region into turmoil and hatred.
Perhaps the most tragic instance of the fanaticism that plagues our region is the cruel war waged by Iran and Iraq for the past six years. That war has claimed well over a million casualties; it has reintroduced outlawed means of warfare such as gas and chemical weapons and the wholesale torture of prisoners; it has hurt the entire world by threatening freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil. It is a sad commentary that, despite their various proclamations, those two warring Governments show no intention whatsoever of genuinely seeking ways to stop the horrible carnage.
Another instance of the reign of fanaticism and its terrible human cost is Lebanon. The tragedy is rooted in the chronic absence of an effective Government able to control and reconcile the warring factions. Without such a strong central authority, Lebanon has been unable to discharge the most elementary obligations of government - the control of one's territory against lawlessness and terror, terror directed against one's own citizens and against the citizens of neighboring States.
The first to pay for that anarchy have been the Lebanese themselves. Over 100,000 were slaughtered in the civil war of 1975-1976 and thousands of others have been killed since in sectarian clashes. Lebanon's Government has set no effective jurisdiction over any part of the country: not over the Bekaa Valley or Tripoli, where 20,000 Syrian troops physically occupy Lebanese territory; not over the Shouf Mountains; not even over Beirut itself. Such conditions encourage the reign of the gun, the rocket and the bomb throughout Lebanon. Naturally, the southern part of the country has not been exempt from that dismal pattern. Beginning with the PLO, various terrorist groups have used the south as a staging area for terrorist attacks against Israel. Those who expected that a ""Pax Syriana"" would pacify Lebanon were hopelessly deluded,.for Syrian domination of Lebanon has meant that Syria has been playing off one factor against another, as well as using Lebanon as a base for proxy terror attacks against Israel
and against targets world-wide.
That Syrian strategy, now shared by Iran, should concern the entire international community. As for Israel, we have one, and only one, objective regarding Lebanon: to protect northern Israel against attacks launched from Lebanon. This is self-defense in its simplest form. We shall not let Israeli citizens pay with their lives for Lebanon's failure to control its territory. We shall continue to take the necessary measures to defend our people. We hope that Lebanon will produce an effective Government with which we can agree on permanent security arrangements. In the meantime we shall continue to work with any Lebanese party genuinely interested in preventing terror in the South of Lebanon and in the North of Israel.
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has tried to assist in bringing stability to the area. It has performed a useful role. It has suffered painful casualties in the process, including losses sustained in a recent rash of murderous attacks. We extend ou£r deepest condolences to the bereaved families end their Governments. We must be clear, however, on what role UNIFIL can and cannot play. International forces are most effective when they serve as buffers between two States that share a commitment to pacifying their common border. Unlike Israel's neighbors on two other borders, that is not the case with Lebanon. That is why UNIFIL, unlike the multinational Force in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights, has been unable to act as an effective buffer, since the day it was established by the United Nations. Peace-keepers cannot be asked to combat terrorists. That role must be left to the Governments and the peoples in the area of turmoil. We shall continue to co-operate with UNIFIL, as we maintain the necessary security arrangements to defend our norther border.
Israel watches with concern the larger conflicts waged in our region: those between radicals and non-radicals, between conservative regimes and revolutionaries, among militant religious movements, and among the various dictatorships themselves. But there is little we can do to affect this tragic and chronic violence. Where we can act - where we have acted and shall continue to act - is in the limited confines of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.
Ever since Israel's independence we have made every effort to achieve peace with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our heritage. The Jewish people is a democratic and free people striving to rebuild its national life in the ancient - the only - homeland of the Jews. Israel is a haven for the persecuted, a land where ever Jew from whatever background feels at home. We can best achieve our ideals and goals in an atmosphere of peace and security. Hence, we cherish peace? we pray for it and we teach its blessings to our children. Our entire people rejoiced when, after decades of war which were forced upon us, we were able to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
During the past year we have made special efforts to broaden that peace. In July, Prime Minister Peres visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. We have made efforts to reinforce the peace treaty with Egypt and to solve the problems that are still outstanding. We hope we are on the threshold of a substantial improvement in the relations between our two countries. Such an improvement is vital in and of itself, and of even greater importance for the prospects for peace
with other Arab States.
A few days ago we marked the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. With the passage of time we can see that those accords were a turning-point in the history of the Middle East. They have proved decisively that there is a way out of the cycle of belligerency, and they have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no alternative to direct negotiations. To this very day they remain the one and only blueprint for accommodation and peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. All attempts to bypass, nullify or denigrate the Camp David accords have failed. Those attempts have been unsuccessful because they have disregarded the minimal needs of all parties, because they were not rooted in achievable proposals acceptable to all the sides.
Camp David accords are still the leading parties to which everyone concerned with peace in the Middle East turns. Together they hold the key to progress towards peace. With its commitment to the accords, Egypt has gained in prestige and stature. Many of those in the Arab world who once attacked and boycotted it are now looking to Egypt to play a leading role in peace negotiations. The United States, of course, is equally sought after. Many have come to appreciate the positive influence it brings to bear on the political process in our region.
For its part, Israel remains anxious and willing to move the peace process forward without delay. The peace treaty with Egypt was intended to be the first in a series of treaties that together would constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.
Those who are afraid of peace or who are seeking to evade peace with Israel are trying to promote an alternative to direct negotiations, and ultimately to peace itself, through an international conference. Let me repeat again: Experience proves that the only path to peace is through direct negotiations. Substitutes for such negotiations can only lead us away from peace. The history of our region provides anple evidence of this simple truth.
The Government of Israel has repeatedly called upon King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct peace negotiations with Israel. We recognize that once he decides to respond to our call Jordan may face considerable opposition from some Arab quarters. That opposition, however, will not be deflected or appeased by such devices as an international conference. Ultimately, Jordan will have to decide whether the advantages of peace with Israel outweigh the risks and difficulties involved in making such a move. But Jordan must understand that its peace will have to be with Israel, not with an international body. The first sign of a
genuine willingness to move towards peace is a declared readiness to deal directly with one's former adversary. There is no other way to a genuine reconciliation.
We firmly believe that the absence of democracy and freedom in our region is a major obstacle to peace. Only democracy offers the guarantee of freedom, the hope of progress and the prospect of peace. We do not believe any people want war. We do not believe the Arab peoples want war. Wars of aggression are initiated by Governments that do not represent the will of their peoples and fail to reflect their aspirations. That is why we must hope that democratic Governments will prevail throughout the Middle East on a not too distant day, for on that day true and permanent peace will come to our region. To hasten the coming of that day we call on all countries interested in peace in the Middle East strongly to support direct talks between Jordan and Israel. We call on them strongly to signify their willingness to buttress and strengthen a peace settlement by declaring their readiness to endorse it immediately. In addition, the supporters of peace should undertake to extend whatever assistance and support may be needed by the Government and the people of Jordan to embark on an ambitious development Program that will accompany the implementation of the peace treaty. The rewards of peace must be swift and exemplary, and serve to belie the words of its opponents.
Our region - the entire world in fact - is plagued by the spread of Arab terrorism. There is no limit to its atrocities. Even places of worship are not immune to this wanton murder. The recent attack on a synagogue in Istanbul was merely the latest and deadliest in a series of such attacks on Jewish places of worship. But Jews are not the only victims. Arab terror has made a blood pact with terrorists from all over the world to fight the common enemy, of which Israel and Jews are merely a part. That enemy is the community of democratic nations. The fight against this menace is therefore the fight of all civilized and free nations.
The so-called PLO was the linchpin of this alliance in terror; it pioneered the art of hijacking, bombing, kidnapping and massacre on an international scale. In the decade preceding 1982 the PLO used its mini-State in Lebanon to train and arm terrorist groups from five continents, from left-wing extremists to neo-Nazi gangs. Libya, Syria and Iran joined in financing, training and arming the terrorists and providing them with safe havens.
Since our action in Lebanon in 1982, the PLO has disintegrated into a number of rival terrorist gangs, most of them mercenaries in the service of various Governments. Their one common objective is to sabotage any attempt at peace and stability. The legacy of terror that they have created has encouraged other terrorist groups, many of them possessed by a mad desire to spread anarchy and terror for no reason whatsoever.
Much has been said about ways to combat international terrorism, but little has been done. Terrorism will continue to take its toll as long as the terrorists believe they can kill with impunity and achieve legitimacy and their political goals in the process. They must be denied these victories. They must never be appeased. They must never be ""understood"". They must always be condemned and fought vigorously. If we are serious in our desire to rid ourselves of international terrorism, we must adopt a broad and comprehensive campaign against the terrorists.
We must expel the representatives of terrorist organizations, starting with the PLO, from all countries committed to the fight against terror. We should hunt down the terrorist killers. They must always be on the run. But no matter what measures we take against the killers themselves, they will not be enough. If we do not go to the source, to the regimes whose support and protection make terrorism possible, we will not succeed in rolling back the tide of terror. We must isolate
and punish those terrorist States. We should shut down their embassies, expel their diplomats, curtail trade with them, and co-ordinate a military response if they persist in attacking us. Those who refuse to address the problem of State-supported terrorism are not merely failing to solve the problem? they are
facilitating its expansion.
Last year, from this rostrum, I spoke of three major threats facing the countries of the Middle East: the escalating race in conventional arms, the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the grave problem of chemical warfare. Unfortunately, little if anything has been done to reduce those threats. In fact, in some ways the situation has worsened in the past year.
The most dramatic development has been the increased use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran. This has been investigated by the united Nations and condemned by the President of the Security Council on behalf of its members. There is also considerable evidence that other States in the Middle East, most notably Syria, are developing a chemical warfare capability. The free world should pool information on this subject and adopt concerted measures to prevent the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons. We cannot afford to cower before dictatorships that stockpile these inhuman inventories, especially since these regimes have shown no hesitation in using them.
To our disappointment, negotiations on a nuclear-weapon-free zone among the States in the region have yet to begin. It is our firm belief that, in an area as sensitive as the Middle East, the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation would be a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries were among those which supported the establishment of our State in 1948. But things have changed. With the exception of Romania, all the Eastern-bloc countries have severed their diplomatic ties with us and adopted a one-sided policy towards the Middle East. We welcome, of course, any sincere attempt at improving relations and re-establishing diplomatic ties between us and any Eastern European country.
This year, for the first time in nearly 20 years, an official meeting took place in Helsinki between representatives of Israel and the Soviet Union. We hope that it is a sign of a positive change in the policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel. Without such a renewal of diplomatic relations and without a major change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Soviet Jews - especially the policy that prevents them from exercising their basic right of repatriation to Israel - it is difficult to see how the Soviet Union could contribute in any way to the attainment of peace in our region.
The plight of our Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union has been raised countless times by Israel's representatives and by world leaders; yet the tragic suffering continues. The hope that a new leadership in the Soviet Union would bring with it an improvement in the situation of Soviet Jewry has, so far, not been borne out. The condition of Soviet Jews, especially those among them wishing to leave for Israel, has deteriorated still further.
In a country of over 100 nationalities, speaking over 100 languages, Jews remain the only officially recognized nationality in the Soviet Union denied the right to maintain its cultural heritage and pass it on to the next generation. They are forbidden to study their ancient language, Hebrew. Throughout the entire length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not a single Jewish school where Jews may study their history, literature and traditions.
In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Soviet Union have expressed their desire to join their people in Israel. But the Soviet authorities have effectively stopped Jewish emigration; less than 500 Jews were allowed to leave during the first eight months of this year. Thousands have had their requests for exit permits repeatedly refused on the flimsiest of pretexts; as punishment for daring to apply to leave, they have been subjected to all manner of harassment and reprisals. Among those ""refuseniks"" are the prisoners-of-Zion, who have been subjected to arrests and lengthy terms of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. The real reason for their imprisonment is painfully clear: it is their insistence on their right to emigrate to Israel and their right to study Hebrew and persevere in their Jewish heritage.
The Soviet policy towards Soviet Jews is a flagrant violation of the International Convention on Human Rights, to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. It is totally contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Accords. The refusal of the Soviet Government to fulfill its most elementary humanitarian obligations must weigh heavily in the considerations of all who would contemplate entering into agreements with the Soviet Union on any subject.
Prom this rostrum, I call upon Governments and people of good will everywhere to urge the Soviet Government to bring its behavior towards Soviet Jews into line with universally accepted international standards. We in Israel will not rest until every Jew in the Soviet Union is permitted to exercise his right to emigrate and until Jews are free to follow their ancestral traditions and faith.
Another beleaguered Jewish community are the Jews of Syria. They are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies. They are not free to live wherever they wish. Several hundred young Jewish women cannot
find husbands in the Jewish community. The Syrian Government has callously refused to allow then to leave the country so that they may marry within their faith and establish families. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return. All that, too, is another instance of flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Syria is a signatory.
None of the problems I have described, including those relating to our region, is insoluble. They can be resolved if the Governments involved muster genuine good will, we turn again to the leaders of our Arab neighbors with an outstretched hand of peace. Let us bring an end to belligerency and hatred. Let us make real the hopes for a new era of understanding and coexistence. We shall not spare any effort in this quest, nor will we give up hope that it will bear fruit.
The eyes and hearts of millions of human beings who are wasting away from hunger and poverty, who live under oppressive regimes that deny them basic human rights, who are victims of barbaric terror, are turned towards us in the hope that we can alleviate their suffering. They look to us, to this body, for the hope of a better future. We cannot let them down and still claim fidelity to the ideals of this Organization. We bear the responsibility to begin action now for their sakes and for the sake of our place in history. Let us not forsake them, or our aspirations for a better and safer world."
5,1984,"ISR_prev_1998","It gives me pleasure, Mr. President, to associate myself with the warm congratulations offered to you from this rostrum. They are a tribute to your country and to yourself, as well as to a continent which is playing such a prominent role in the United Nations. I hope and trust that, under your leadership and guidance, the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly will be constructive, positive and responsive to the grave problems that face us.
101.	It is gratifying to observe the family of nations grow from year to year, reinforced with new partners in our common endeavours. The United Nations will either stand or fall on the principle of universality. The only attitude we should disavow is the promotion of narrow, selfish interests which run counter to our common international efforts.
102.	Every session of the General Assembly must set out in a spirit of hope that, despite the disappointments of the past, we can and should renew our efforts and work for a better world. Forty years ago, the founders of the United Nations looked back on a tragic past and undertook to forge instruments that would ensure a better future for humanity. So do we, in accordance with ancient Jewish tradition, look back year after year upon the disappointments of the past with firm belief in a better future, buoyed by an unflagging hope in the triumph of that human spirit which never deserts us.
103.	The fortieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War will occur in 1985, as has already been noted from this rostrum. This was a landmark in history and even more so in the annals of my people. Israel and the Jewish people, who still carry so many scars of that terrible war, will commemorate the occasion appropriately. The event will undoubtedly be marked by all nations, as was indeed recommended by the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly, which invited States Members ""to adopt . . . measures declaring punishable by law any dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred . . . including Nazi, Fascist and neo- Fascist ideologies"". The Assembly also appealed to all States to accede to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. There are still a few pockets of neo-Nazism that continue to linger, and they should be dealt with firmly, but the true heirs to this inhuman creed are those organizations and Governments that continue to this day to deny the right of existence of another State and strive for its outright destruction. There should be no room in civilized society for such doctrines or for those who promote them.
104.	The United Nations concept embraces the whole of mankind. Its raison d'etre is the welfare, present and future, of humanity, with special attention accorded to the underprivileged, the disabled and the oppressed. Our special attention should be focused on the problems of children and of youth and on their appropriate education and training. This should be our central task in building up our nations and societies.
105.	The coming year will be marked by the conclusion of the United Nations Decade for Women, with the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the Decade to be held at Nairobi. Our hope is that that Conference will become a high point in women's struggle for equality and will not be exploited for narrow and barren political interests.
106.	Technological progress holds the promise of providing solutions to some of the most pressing problems of developing nations, but nowhere is it more sorely needed than in the field of agriculture and food production. It is now widely recognized that the international development effort has failed to meet its most important challenge, the production of food for the fast-growing population of our world. Agriculture is the key to the present challenge, but its development and that of the rural society that sustains it have been sadly neglected.
107.	Great strides have been made world-wide in industry, in the development of infrastructure, transportation, education and health, but food production has remained deficient. It is a terribly sad comment on our society that in this modern age millions go hungry and die of famine; hundreds of millions, mainly children, suffer malnutrition, their future as productive members of their society endangered. Per capita food production in Africa, for instance, has in fact dropped 15 per cent in the last decade. Countries in other continents have required emergency food supplies. Nations that were once self-sufficient have become importers of food and, as a result of their economic difficulties stemming from the increase in the cost of energy, their true independence has become endangered.
108.	Catastrophe awaits many nations if we do not find the way to assure adequate food for our world's growing population. World security and stability begin with the assurance of basic human needs. A change of direction is thus urgently needed in the goals of international development. That is the challenge of this decade. This goal can be reached despite the scarcity of arable land and water and despite the meagre resources that are available in various countries. In fact, Israel has emerged in only one generation from severe austerity and food rationing to self-reliance; we have increased our food production twelvefold and have become a net exporter of food.
109.	Israel recently marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of its programme for international development co-operation. This programme had its beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the emergence of newly independent nations that sought rapid development. Imbued with a pioneering spirit that thrived on successful adaptation and innovation in the development of their own country, the people of Israel considered it a duty to share the knowledge acquired through their own rapid development experience with the peoples of other emerging nations.
110.	Israel calls upon all Governments to set aside political differences and narrow economic interests to join forces in the campaign against hunger. Israel will continue to co-operate with other nations in technology and development and stands ready to join other Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in working to meet this great challenge to humanity.
111.	Israel is the fulfilment of an age-old dream and prayer for the re-establishment of the Jewish State in the Land of Israel. It is the home of all Jews who wish to make it their home, and it is the defender and protector of all Jews who are oppressed or persecuted because they belong to the Jewish people. These principles are enshrined in Israel's Declaration of Independence, in its laws and in the conscience of its people.
112.	We are aghast at the fact that, 40 years after the eradication of Nazism, rampant anti-Semitism and racial discrimination still exist in a number of countries. The situation of Soviet Jewry has recently taken a definite turn for the worse. From this rostrum I call upon the Government of the Soviet Union to remove the harsh limitations and restrictions imposed upon Jews who seek repatriation and reunion with their brethren in Israel. The continued harassment of Soviet Jews has become one of the most pressing humanitarian problems of the day, a violation of the most basic human rights as expressed in the Helsinki accords. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are being systematically denied their rights and many are forced to live as outcasts, deprived of their livelihood, harassed or imprisoned in gaols and labour camps under inhuman conditions.
113.	Soviet Jews are deprived of access to Jewish culture. A systematic campaign is waged against those Soviet Jews teaching and studying the Hebrew language. Ill-concealed under the cloak of anti-zionism, officially inspired anti-Semitism is being increasingly manifested in the Soviet media.
114.	We call upon the Soviet Government to change its policy, which is unjustifiable. The Soviet Jews are not involved in any anti-Soviet activity, nor are they violating Soviet laws or working against Soviet interests. Their only wish is to study their ancient culture and their national language and to live as Jews in their historic homeland. It should be recalled that in front of this very Assembly official representatives of the Soviet Union have declared that the Jewish people have a right to a State of their own. Soviet Jewry demands nothing more than to exercise this right.
115.	In our own part of the world, the Middle East, the Jews of Syria continue to suffer under a harsh regime that holds them hostage and refuses to grant them basic human rights, the most important of which is the right to emigrate and join their brethren. Periodic killings of Jews, either sanctioned or tolerated by the authorities, maintain a climate of terror among the Jews of Syria.
116.	In Ethiopia, an ancient Jewish community struggles to maintain its heritage, culture and integrity under dire hardship. We acknowledge the gesture of the Ethiopian Government, which has recently enabled Jews and non-Jews from all over the world to visit that community, and we express our sincere hope that it will take all necessary steps to protect and respect their religious and cultural rights and enable those who so desire to be reunited with their families in their ancient homeland.
117.	On 13 September 1984, a Government of national unity, encompassing the overwhelming majority of political parties in Israel, was established. Its creation is a reflection of the wide consensus that unites the people of Israel on the main issues on the Government's agenda in the economic, defence and political domains.
118.	In its foreign relations, Israel is dedicated, as always, to the goal of peace and accommodation with all its neighbours. In the north, we stand ready to reach an understanding with Lebanon which will guarantee the security of our common border and thus make possible the withdrawal of all forces from southern Lebanon. Syria remains dogmatically opposed to the idea of peace with Israel. Nevertheless, we are adamant in our conviction that there can be no solution other than peace. In the east, we have repeatedly called on the Government of Jordan to join us in negotiations for peace. In the south, of course, we have peace with Egypt, but we are convinced that peaceful relations should be deepened and strengthened in the face of so much rejectionist pressure against peace.
119.	The chances of progress towards further peace and stability between Israel and its neighbours must be appraised, however, in the context of the realities of the region.
120.	The Middle East continues to be beset by violence, bitter conflicts and wars. In a few weeks of bloodshed along the Iran-Iraq border, more men and children die than in all the Arab-Israel wars. Thousands die every year in domestic strife and hostilities entirely unconnected with the Arab-Israel conflict. Yet, as everyone in this Hall knows full well, a disproportionate amount of the time of the General Assembly is devoted year after year to a contrived and counter-productive review of the Arab-Israel conflict, the main purpose of which seems to be only to slander Israel.
121.	In the last two decades, the violence and oppression that characterize so many regimes in the Middle East have erupted on the international scene in waves of terrorism, hijacking and assassination. When in 1972 the Secretary-General proposed that the United Nations promote measures to counter international terrorism, we were among the first to welcome that initiative. Regrettably, it has been thwarted by States that sponsor and support terrorism. Middle Eastern terrorism, sanctioned by these Governments, has been thus allowed, through neglect and indifference, to expand to more and more countries. Today the cancer of terrorism has spread to all continents. The latest form of terrorism and international piracy is the mines that threaten shipping and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Recently, we were again horrified by the murderous bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a calculated and deliberate act of terrorism.
122.	Terror is a malignant disease that will spread everywhere if not contained. But at least in one instance concerted international effort has produced results. When terrorism first raised its ugly head in the mid-1960s, its prime target was international civil aviation. Planes were hijacked almost daily, aircraft bombed, passengers terrorized and murdered. The proper functioning of civil aviation today is a result of powerful measures taken jointly by many nations to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft and to combat the threat of hijackings. But such successful international co-operation remains an exception. Terrorism is still an item on the Assembly's agenda, but it is debated ineffectively, shunted aside by vested interests which offer its representatives support, sustenance and even quasi- recognition. As long as the family of nations continues to evade its responsibilities, to appease rather than punish, to pardon terrorists rather than prosecute or extradite them, to afford terrorists diplomatic immunity, the disease will spread and claim yet more victims in our homes and communities.
123.	Whenever a particularly outrageous terrorist attack takes place, as for example the recent bombing of the United States Embassy at Beirut, a wave of outrage sweeps public opinion in all parts of the civilized world. People naturally demand instant retaliation against such despicable acts and a fitting punishment for the criminal perpetrators.
124.	While punishment has its necessary place in any system of justice, the overriding problem here is not whom to punish and how punishment should be delivered. Rather, it is how to prevent terrorism and root it out from the international arena. There is only one way to deal with this problem. Those countries which agree that terrorism must be eradicated should join forces and wage a permanent war on the terrorist organizations. This is the only way to expose, pre-empt, weaken and finally destroy them. This is a war of self-defence in its true sense, a campaign that the free world should undertake on behalf of its peoples and of the entire human race.
125.	For its part, Israel has been waging an unrelenting war on Arab terrorism and has dealt it a number of crippling blows. The so-called PLO, which had established its own mini-terrorist State in Lebanon, from which it carried out and assisted terrorist acts in five continents, was expelled from that country. But Israel cannot be expected to shoulder alone the burden of fighting international terrorism. Since we are all potential victims of terror, we must fight it together. If we do not, terrorism will endanger our basic freedoms and all the standards of civilized behaviour for which the United Nations stands.
126.	The attitude underpinning Arab terrorist attacks against Israel is the continued denial by Arab States of Israel's right to exist. Translated into wanton attacks on civilians, the ideology is cruel and inhuman. But it has produced the very opposite result to that intended. Israel has taken the necessary measures to protect its people and enable them to live and prosper alongside their Arab neighbours throughout the Land of Israel. We have to state with regret that any sign of ostensible moderation in the attitude of Arab Governments towards Israel is negated by their sustenance and support of terrorist organizations committed to Israel's destruction and by their continued attempts to expel Israel from United Nations bodies and other international organizations. We will welcome a change in the Arab stance if it is given concrete expression, such as a clear-cut disengagement from the so-called PLO and other terrorist organizations and a straightforward statement of readiness to make peace with Israel.
127.	Sadly, such a breakthrough for peace was set back by the General Assembly's rejection of the Camp David accords and the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, for no other reason than that certain Arab States reject the idea of peace with Israel. Camp David has been the only ray of light in an otherwise dismal and dark picture of hostility. It will continue to serve as a beacon of hope until its message is finally accepted by the peoples and Governments of our region.
128.	The United Nations can contribute to peace in the Middle East by a change of direction. It should embrace the idea of peace between Israel and its neighbours condemn the blatant attacks on Israel and reject outright the attempts to expel it from international forums. Recently, an attempt to expel Israel from the UPU was properly rejected by an overwhelming majority. It is now time for the United Nations as a whole to muster the courage to condemn such behaviour. It will mark an important milestone in rehabilitating the image of the United Nations and its standing in the world community.
129.	Recently, the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East was resurrected. It was advanced by a State that has no diplomatic relations with Israel and that recommends the participation of representatives of terrorist groups. The Arab-Israel dispute is not in need of another international forum. There have been more than enough such gatherings and proposals, and they have all proved futile. They served as a stage for propaganda and for competition between Arab States in the politics of public confrontation with Israel. A conference such as the one being proposed would strike a blow at the principle of direct negotiations, which has proved to be the only means of producing agreements between Israel and its neighbours, from the time of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949 through the Camp David accords in 1978.
130.	We therefore call on Member States that have the interest of peace at heart to bring their influence to bear on our Arab neighbours to the east and north to adopt the only successful and tested path to peace—direct negotiations with Israel.
131.	Such negotiations produced the agreement with Lebanon which was signed on 17 May 1983. That agreement provided for security arrangements against terrorism and an agreed basis for normal relations between our two countries across the recognized international boundaries. It was approved by the legislatures of Israel and Lebanon, but Syria and those that cannot tolerate the idea of peace with Israel destroyed it by the application of sheer, brutal force. The agreement was designed to lead to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, the restoration of Lebanese independence and the establishment of security measures along the Lebanon- Israel border.
132.	Today, some 40,000 Syrian troops occupy 65 per cent of Lebanon and show no sign of any intention to leave. The Lebanese Government is dominated by Syria and is not capable of conducting free negotiations that would resolve its problems with Israel. Obviously, Israel will ensure its legitimate security needs and make the necessary arrangements in southern Lebanon to protect the people of northern Israel against any repetition of the terrorist attacks of recent years. I reiterate our readiness to withdraw all our forces from Lebanon, subject to the above-mentioned arrangements.
133.	By now it should be clear to everyone, including the Arab States in our area, that Israel has no interest in maintaining any military presence in Lebanon. But we have to make certain that after the last Israeli soldier leaves Lebanon, the terrorists will not return to attack us.
134.	Let me repeat: anyone, any people or State that is interested in the evacuation of the Israel army from Lebanon must see to it that the terrorist organizations expelled from Lebanon by Israel do not return to our borders to renew their attacks. This is an essential condition for peace. Israel is ready to cooperate in any serious effort towards a fair solution to this problem.
135.	Since the conclusion of the Camp David accords, Israel has repeatedly called on Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Arabs to join in negotiations for an agreement on autonomy. Unfortunately, Egypt has discontinued its participation in the talks, while Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs have refused to join them. Arab rejectionism and extremism continue to have a stranglehold on those who may have been willing to embark on the path of moderation and peace.
136.	From this rostrum, I turn yet again to our neighbours with the same call. Let us move forward together on a new path. Let us talk to one another. Let us engage in a common effort to resolve our conflicts, rather than perpetuate the negative attitudes which find frequent expression in this building.
137.	Until this call is heeded, Israel will continue to strive for an end to Arab rejectionist attitudes and aspire to mutual acceptance, tolerance, understanding and dialogue, which are consonant with the most basic goals of the United Nations.
138.	Israel is aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and of the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international arrangements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
139.	Israel has long been concerned by the dangers posed by nuclear armaments and has therefore consistently supported the objective of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
140.	We believe that the most credible barrier to proliferation in such a sensitive area as the Middle East is a freely negotiated nuclear-weapon-free zone. In this belief, we are encouraged by the Latin American experience and the recent progress towards establishing the South Pacific as a nuclear-weapon- free zone.
141.	In the vital field of disarmament, we are impelled by a permanent moral imperative. Progress in this field is indispensable if we are to remove the nuclear threat. It may be a commonplace to say that time is running out, but it is nevertheless true. A very recent experience demonstrates that weapons, once they exist, are used. During the current terrible Iran- Iraq war, new non-conventional weapons, such as gas, have been used. This latest addition to the arsenal of fighting armies, against established international conventions and basic decency, cannot but arouse the deepest anxiety. It should be opposed vigorously by anyone concerned for the future of our civilization. All of us are aware that a moderation of the armament spiral, both conventional and non- conventional, will free huge resources needed for the welfare of mankind, in particular that of the developing countries.
142.	In conclusion, our mission is twofold. Our first task is the improvement of the quality of life in this world, especially for those who are suffering or who lack the means of sustenance; the hungry millions are waiting for us to do our duty. Our second task is to concert our efforts to eradicate from our midst terrorism and all other violations of civilized norms. We must dedicate equal effort to achieving both goals. We cannot accomplish our humanitarian task unless we overcome the dangers that threaten our society. Both objectives can be achieved provided we muster the courage and the will to do so. Our reward will be true peace. There can be no greater goal for the United Nations.
143.	The vision of our ancient prophets of universal peace was intended for a distant, Utopian future. But, if we succeed in removing these two formidable obstacles—hunger and terrorism—from our path, the march of humanity towards the fulfilment of that vision will be immeasurably advanced, our stride quickened and our hearts uplifted with the promise of better days."
5,1978,"ISR_prev_1998","70.	Mr. President, permit me to join the representatives who have spoken before me in this general debate by offering you the congratulations of the delegation of Israel on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will guide this session with fairness and wisdom.
71,	It is my pleasure also to congratulate Solomon Islands on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
72	As we reflect upon the work of the United Nations over the past year one undertaking stands out above all others: it is the noble attempt to reach an agreement on disarmament, to divert precious resources to improving the lot of the common man
73	In the Middle East we recently witnessed an unprecedented escalation in the quantity of weapons purchased by the Arab States, amounting to $11 billion in orders since the beginning of 1977. Indeed, over the past five years the arms agreements signed by those States mean that they have outstripped both the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the countries members of the Warsaw Pact Organization in the ratio of their arms build-up.
74.	Israel is prepared to play its part in the reduction of the arms race and it remains ready to enter into agreements on arms limitation with all States in the Middle East. There is no doubt, however, that the appropriate way to bring about an arms reduction in the Middle East is through peace treaties which would include limitations on armaments within their framework Indeed, the mere transformation from a state of war to one of peace will move the States involved to dedicate their resources to economic development rather than military aims.
75.	Terrorist groups continue to threaten the lives of innocent men, women and children in different parts of the world. Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries did not continue to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. Yet we are gratified that States which once stood helplessly by have begun to assert themselves.
Mention should be made, for example, of the Federal Republic of Germany's rescue operation in Mogadishu and of the joint statement on international terrorism of the Heads of State 'or Government at the recent Bonn Economic Summit Conference,6 wherein they recognized the need for immediate action to cease all flights to and from a country which refuses to extradite or prosecute hijackers of aircraft. It is only through such concerted and effective action that the world can be freed from organized terrorism.

76.	In the field of human rights no State should ignore a violation of human rights wherever it may occur in the world.
77.	Israel continues to follow closely the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union. We welcome the recent increase in the number of exit visas issued, although a large number of Jews are still denied the elementary human rights to emigrate. In addition, administrative obstacles and arbitrary restrictions still threaten the social and economic livelihood and personal freedom of Jews seeking to emigrate.
78.	We have been particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences passed this year on Jews whose only crime is their desire to rejoin their families in Israel-Grigorij Goldstein, Iosif Begun, Ida Nudel, Vladimir Slepak, Simon Shnirman and Anatoly Scharansky. Those sentences caused bitter protest and indignation throughout the world. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and allow those who want to emigrate to Israel and rejoin their families to do so.
79.	We cannot be silent in the face of the increasing incitement of feeling against and defamation of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, their religion, culture and national movement, manifested day after day in the official Soviet media. Those anti-Semitic attacks, unprecedented in their intensity, may have most dangerous consequences. In this regard it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their ancient traditions and culture, and in fact take severe measures against Jews who wish to do so. We appeal Jo the Soviet Union to allow Jewish culture to be expressed freely.
80.	We also deeply regret that the Syrian Government continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and be reunited with their relatives residing in other lands.
81.	One of the most important trends in world , politics today remains the determined aspiration of the new and under-developed nations to take their place in the international political and economic arena. Being a developing nation itself, Israel strongly identifies with the aspirations of nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America to transform their political independence into a full and equal economic partnership with the older-established nations of the world.
82 To that end the North-South dialogue, with its guidelines on the transfer of resources, marks an important
beginning, and the Government of Israel appreciates the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies in encouraging this process. My Government particularly welcomes the results of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries in Buenos Aires, where Israel proposed a voluntary agreement for the exchange of technical assistance among developing countries. Israel has been co-operating for more than 30 years with other developing nations in fields such as irrigation techniques, seed production, desalination, solar energy and the agricultural development of arid and semi-arid zones. We view the expansion of such co-operative efforts as vital if the serious food shortages that still exist in so much of the world are to be overcome .
83.	A year ago I addressed this Assembly on the prospects of launching a peace process in the Middle East. Today I have the satisfaction of being able to address the General Assembly on the new and positive developments that have taken place recently.
84.	As all members of the Assembly know, a few weeks ago at Camp David two framework agreements8 were signed by President Anwar El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and witnessed by President Jimmy Carter of the United States of America. Within a very few days from now negotiations will start between Israel and Egypt for the conclusion of a peace treaty between them.
85.	It is my hope that these negotiations will be successful and that before the year is out we shall witness the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. It is our desire that the peace process should eventually embrace the other States that are our neighbours—Jordan, Lebanon and Syria-so that we may achieve a comprehensive settlement in the area.
86.	The gratitude of my country goes out to President Jimmy Carter, whose devoted efforts have made the Camp David developments possible When this achievement ends with an Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, President Carter's name will be recorded in history as that of a great peacemaker.
87.	I also wish to express my country's deep appreciation to President Anwar El-Sadat of the Arab Republic of Egypt for his wisdom and faith. His visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 turned a new page. He decided to enter into negotiations with Israel, to recognize Israel and to make peace with Israel. This change in policy ushered in a historic change in the relations between Egypt and Israel. The previous policy based on the ""three Nos"" of Khartoum 19679—no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel—prevented any progress towards a peace settlement.
88.	Now the road to peace lies open. The warm reception accorded to President El-Sadat by the people and Government of Israel constituted an acknowledgement of this change in the Egyptian policy. A new era of peace, for which Israel has been longing since its establishment, has started. Prime Minister Begin's courage and leadership were a decisive factor. Without his readiness and ability to assume responsibility for very painful decisions, the achievements reached at Camp David would not have been conceivable.
89.	Not only since the founding of the State of Israel but since the very beginning of the Zionist movement our dream has always been of a Middle East in which Jew and Arab would live in harmony and co-operation for the mutual advantage of both peoples.
90.	The Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel is a step in this direction. It provides for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces and civilian population from Sinai; for the establishment of normal relations between the two countries, including diplomatic, economic and cultural relations, and full recognition; the termination of economic boycotts and of barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and mutual protection of citizens by due process of law. It also stipulates that there shall be free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, and that the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba are international waterways to be open to all nations for navigation and over flight.
91.	In view of the several wars launched by our neighbours, we are conscious of our security needs. Therefore, in addition to the establishment of normal relations between the two States, there will be security arrangements concerning the limitation of armaments and forces in the different areas on the basis of reciprocity.
92.	Moreover, the framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel also provides for the stationing of United Nations forces at Sham el Sheikh to ensure freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran. Similarly, there is a provision for their being stationed in northern Sinai, thus creating a ""buffer zone"" between the forces stationed in El-Arish and those in Gaza. These forces will not be removed unless such removal is approved by the Security Council of the United Nations. It should be noted here that in recent years the United Nations forces in the Middle East have played a constructive role with the framework of the various agreed arrangements in the. region.
93.	It has never been the wish of Israel to exercise control over the lives and activities of the Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza.
94.	We want to live as equals with the Arab inhabitants of those areas. We want to live with them, not to replace them; but at the same time we do not regard ourselves as foreigners in those areas. The Israeli settlements in Judaea and Samaria and in the Gaza district are there as of right. It is inconceivable to us that Jews should be prohibited from settling and living in Judaea and Samaria, which are the heart of our homeland.
95.	We maintain our army positions in those areas in order to ensure the security of the population of Israel, the majority of whom live in the Mediterranean coastal area. The Israeli forces are there in order to protect Israel and not in order to interfere in the lives of the Arab inhabitants. Under the agreement for the Framework for Peace in the Middle East, the Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn from those areas once a self-governing authority is freely elected by their inhabitants. The Israeli defence forces will be redeployed in those areas and maintained for security purposes. The final status of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza and their relationship with their neighbours will be negotiated during a period of five years following the establishment of the self-governing authority.
96.	One of the subjects that will be discussed between the parties will undoubtedly be the question concerning Jerusalem. For us, the city of Jerusalem is the one and only eternal capital of Israel. We have not, and we shall never have, any other capital city, whether or not others recognize it as such. This eternal city is holy to three religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam. However, our connexion with it is not just religious, but derives from the totality of Jewish national history. Jerusalem is the heart and soul of the Jewish people. It is now united once again, as it should be, free and open for all to come and go. All religious communities should be in complete control of their own holy places and of their own religious life, and all should enjoy the rights of free worship. The inhabitants of the city should live together in harmony with a representative municipal council supervising all essential functions. We have resolved never again to compromise the unity of Jerusalem, and it is our hope that other peoples will share our position.
97.	It was agreed at Camp David that a peace settlement in the Middle East should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council. Resolution 242(1967) is a carefully worked out set of principles establishing a framework of peace to be negotiated among the contending States. It makes clear mat the final borders must be negotiated bilaterally among the States concerned.
98 Let us hope that all those whose co-operation is essential in obtaining peace in the Middle East will not short-sightedly remain outside the peace process. We have to find agreed and appropriate ways for Jews and Arabs to live together in equality, trust and mutual respect.















"
5,1985,"ISR_prev_1998","Sir, at the outset I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high position of President of the General Assembly for the fortieth session. I am convinced that your wealth of diplomatic experience and proven skills will contribute to the enrichment of the deliberations during this special session.
This year we are commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, which was established with many hopes and expectations in the aftermath of a world distraught by death, destruction and the plunder of war.
Like many other peoples, but significantly different from them, the Jewish people underwent an ordeal which will leave its eternal mark not only in the long annals of its history but also in its deeper spiritual and psychological experience. This was, of course, the horrendous Holocaust which was wrought upon us by nazism and anti-semitism. For this reason the emergence of the United Nations provided a source of inspiration and light for us at the end of a very dark era in our history.
Indeed, what could be more stirring than the unequivocal declarations of principle appearing in the opening paragraphs of the United Nations Charter, such as: ""We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and the call ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors""? To my great regret, however, this Organization has had a part in shattering these aspirations and noble ideals.
The slander of anti-semitism has also been propagated in the guise of anti-zionism. In this context, we sadly note the tenth anniversary of the passing of the infamous General Assembly resolution falsely equating the Jewish National Liberation Movement - Zionism - with an outrageous phenomenon totally alien to the most fundamental and spiritual values of the Jewish heritage. That resolution, 3379 (XXX), of 10 November 1975, will be remembered in the history of the United Nations as a terrible blot on its record and a discredit to the Organization and to those irresponsible Members that supported it.
Other international forums have also been exploited for the purpose of propaganda and political warfare against Israel, distorting the real purposes for which they were established. It would, therefore, be appropriate and timely to strive for what I would call ""political disarmament"" in these bodies, in order to guarantee that they maintain their integrity and credibility in the exercise of their legitimate functions.
Israel was established in 1948 against the background of a United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. The United Nations, however, did nothing to implement its resolution, and the State of Israel came into being through the will, the toil and the sacrifice of its people. Nor, I might add, did the United Nations alleviate the immense threats and dangers that Israel had to face since its establishment.
Since the founding of the State we have made every possible effort towards the achievement of peace and the normalization of relations with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our national heritage. The Jewish people is a small, democratic and free people, striving to rebuild its renewed nationhood in its ancient homeland. We cherish peace and we teach its blessings to our children. Indeed, after a prolonged period of strife and hostility forced on us by our neighbors, we found a way to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.
Egypt and Israel have demonstrated clearly that face-to-face negotiations and direct dialog are the most constructive and beneficial ways of achieving peace. This was brought about on the basis of the Camp David Accords, which established a just and effective framework for the settlement of conflicts. It is for this reason that Israel is so insistent on applying this framework to the further extension of the peace process. We hope that in the near future we shall be able to negotiate with Jordan, our neighbor to the East. It is crucial that the peace treaty with Egypt should not remain the sole example of peace with our neighbors, and therefore we earnestly seek to widen and deepen that peace by extending the process to include the rest of our Arab neighbors.
From this rostrum I once again urge King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct negotiations with Israel - not in some vague, deflecting international forum, but in direct, bilateral discussions. An international conference is a means of evading direct negotiations. It will be a stage for hostile and extreme propaganda and will not serve the cause of peace. Our aim should be the achievement of a bilaterally negotiated peace treaty between our countries. There is no change in our deep commitment to the Camp David accords, and we stand ready therefore to meet a Jordanian delegation, which may include Arab Palestinians from Judea, Samaria and Gaza, or other Arab Palestinians to be mutually agreed upon.
Israel firmly believes that there is no way to solve the problems of our region except through negotiations and peace. If King Hussein has finally decided to offer his hand in peace, let him act the way the late President Sadat did. He should not drown the quest for peace in a sea of conditions that nullify any chance of peace - conditions such as an international conference and the participation of terrorist organizations in the peace process. I should also like to urge King Hussein to free himself at this eleventh hour, from the clutches of the PLO. King Hussein has been caught in their clutches before and it seems that he has failed to learn from his own experience. Only after freeing himself from his dangerous association with the PLO terrorists will it be possible to achieve progress towards peace between Israel and Jordan. Indeed, the recent marked increase in terror attacks against Israelis stems, among other things, from Hussein's partnership with the PLO. Jordan cannot extend the olive branch of peace on the one hand and play host to terror at the same time. The two are mutually exclusive.
Our position in this regard is clear and decisive. We are firmly against any contacts or dealings with terrorists or their representatives - and, in this case, with an organization whose declared purpose is the liquidation of Israel. PLO leaders have been intimating that they are engaged in the political process of peace. However, they have been waging cruel and murderous terrorist activity all along. According to their declared program, political action and terrorist activities should go hand in hand until they achieve their goal, the elimination of Israel. He are not ready to negotiate with terror. There is no place for its self-proclaimed representatives at a table where peace, security and tranquility are to be negotiated. Acknowledging that organization would be tantamount to legitimizing terror, and should be rejected by all those who value peace.
To protect our people and territory from terror, we were obliged to act against the PLO terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon, which posed an intolerable threat to our people in the Galilee region.
Meanwhile, terror continues to wreak havoc in Lebanon. The latest outrage was the kidnapping of four Soviet diplomats in Beirut. Kidnapping and the holding of hostages for ransom is only one of the manifestations of international terrorism, whose linchpin is the PLO, which we roust fight and stamp out. This is another example of the fact that terror knows no bounds, neither political nor any other.
The removal of the various threats from Israel's northern border continues to be an important priority for us. We will do all in our power to defend and protect the population of the north. This objective has become no less important in the wake of the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from Lebanon, in accordance with the decision of the Government of Israel of 14 January 1935.
Yesterday Israel took action against terror bases, this time in Tunisia. Israel's air force acted against the terrorists only after it became evident that the terrorists were mounting attacks from Tunis with impunity. Only last week, PLO terrorists, who were directed and commanded from Tunis, attacked an Israeli boat in Larnaca, Cyprus, and murdered three Israeli civilians in cold blood. In recent months, those headquarters were responsible for a number of seaborne attempts
against our people, which were prevented by Israel's navy. We had no intention of attacking Tunisia, although that country has permitted terrorist bases to exist on its soil. We acted against murderous criminals in order to prevent the continuation of their criminal acts.
The United Nations has been sadly remiss in meeting the challenge of international and PLO terror. It could and should have come out resolutely against this evil phenomenon of our time and placed it outside the pale of civilization. Instead, it has equivocated and, worse, legitimized terror in terms that have provided encouragement to the terrorists and their supporters.
I regret to state that, in spite of numerous outrages and continuing attacks by PLO terrorists, this issue has never been seriously addressed by the Security Council or other United Nations and international forums. Israel cannot be expected to ignore this double standard. In spite of this, Israel is willing to act with other free nations to curb, if not stamp out, terrorism. Similarly, we urge joint international action against terrorists and their sponsors.
Among the most distressing and oppressing phenomena of our international experience is racism. The very word evokes dark and brutal memories of the long history of the Jewish people. Apartheid is a system of discrimination which the Jewish faith and the State of Israel totally reject and repudiate. The Government of Israel, on 11 August 1985, reiterated that it is unconditionally opposed to the policy of apartheid in South Africa and to any discrimination on grounds of race, religion or color or on any other grounds.
Israel has diplomatic relations with some of the African States and we are ready to renew our relations with those with which we do not have them. This is, of course, up to them. We believe that many have by now seen who the real friends of Africa are: it is not those who use high-flown words but will not lend a helping hand in time of need and distress, or those who remember Africa only when they need its votes at the United Nations. The State of Israel, in contrast, was one of the first to reach out to the nations of Africa, in their early years of sovereignty and statehood and in their current travails, and we are ready to increase our efforts.
In the area of disarmament the nations of the Middle Bast are confronted with three main challenges. These are the reduction of conventional arms, the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the eradication of the use. of chemical warfare. My Government believes that concerted regional action on all three issues is a moral imperative of the highest priority.
Concerning the accumulation of conventional arras, Israel voices its concern over the accelerated supply of large quantities of weapons to a number of belligerent Arab Governments in our region. These regimes do not need these arms for their defense, but are stockpiling them to use against Israel. This can only serve to undermine the chances for peace in the Middle East.
On the subject of nuclear weapons, we believe that the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation in so sensitive an area as the Middle Bast is a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, based on a system of obligations binding' on all States concerned. Israel stands ready to begin such negotiations without delay or preconditions.
While Israel is conscious of the necessity to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are also aware of the substantial contribution which the peaceful use of nuclear energy can make to the well-being of the world and the right of all countries to benefit from such uses. We support those international agreements that would ensure the status and inviolability of nuclear facilities dedicated to peaceful purposes.
Another issue that arouses the deepest anxiety is the repeated use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and the danger that such use may spread in a manner that could not easily be reversed, if at all. It is tragic that the sixtieth anniversary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbidding the use of such weapons should be commemorated in this manner. This total disregard for solemn international legal obligations by Iraq demonstrates the difficulty of achieving genuine disarmament. But we must not despair; we must continue our efforts in this vital field of human endeavor.
The deteriorating situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union obliges us once again to speak out in defense of their elementary rights. Our concern relates especially to the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews who have indicated their desire to join their people in Israel. The Soviet authorities, however, in flagrant violation of the Helsinki Final Act and many other international obligations assumed by the Soviet Government, refuse them permission to leave.
Many of those Jews who have been denied permission to leave are forced to live as outcasts from Soviet society, subject to all manner of official harassment and persecution, while being effectively deprived of the means of legal redress. Increasing numbers have been engulfed in recent months in an accelerating wave of arrests, trials and savage sentences of imprisonment on trumped-up criminal charges. Jews seeking to disseminate knowledge of the Hebrew language have been prominent among these recent victims of judicial repression. These Jews are in no way violating Soviet law, nor are they involved in any form of anti-Soviet activity. Their real crimes, in the eyes of the authorities, are their persistent demand to leave for Israel and their efforts, in the face of strenuous official opposition, to perpetuate their Jewish heritage, culture and religion.
All of these outrages are taking place against the background of a relentless campaign of anti-semitic incitement, usually camouflaged as anti-zionism, in the officially controlled media - a campaign designed by the authorities to encourage an attitude of suspicion, hatred and contempt towards Soviet Jews on the part of the Soviet population.
We call upon all persons of goodwill and all Governments in the civilized world to join us in our protests and in urging the Soviet authorities to conform their policies towards Soviet Jewry to the international obligations solemnly undertaken by the Soviet Government.
Israel seeks good relations with all States including, naturally, the Soviet Union. We have looked to the new Soviet leadership for signs of change in its attitude towards Soviet Jewry. Regrettably, so far we have seen no positive changes whatsoever. .We therefore have no choice but to continue to expose energetically and protest vigorously these flagrant violations of the rights of our fellow Jews seeking to join their people in Israel. He shall continue to do so untiA every Soviet Jew who so wishes is free to exercise this basic right.
There is also the problem of the Jews of Syria, who are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies and are not free to choose to live wherever they wish. This is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which Syria is a signatory. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return.
Several hundred young Jewish women remain unmarried because of the depleted male Jewish population in Syria. The Syrian Government has cruelly refused to allow those women to leave the country in order to be able to marry within their faith and establish families.
tJe are also concerned about the small, ancient Jewish community left in Ethiopia, because of its isolation and suffering and the latest disasters that have befallen that country. Some of these Jews have already returned to their historic homeland and have been received as long-lost brothers and sisters who have finally returned home.
The people of Israel and its Government have expressed their solidarity with the Ethiopian people, which has undergone much suffering as a result of the recent famine and other difficulties. We appeal to the Ethiopian Government to respect the cultural and religious rights of the Jewish community and to enable it to continue to maintain its heritage and religion and, on humanitarian grounds, to permit those among them who so desire to be reunited with their families in Israel.
The fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations may be a fitting occasion for a review and reappraisal of its activities, in frank and constructive self-criticism.
The United Nations should not merely celebrate its past but also plan for its future.
Some may feel disheartened by the fact that, after so many years of United Nations preoccupation with the problems of the developing countries, we still remain so distant from the goal of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich nations of the world. Poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease still characterize the conditions of life in many parts of the world.
One inescapable conclusion is that progress has too often been hampered by a tendency to substitute slogans for serious plans of action. Meeting the world's pressing economic and social problems will require new dimensions of international co-operation. The danger of famine continues to afflict developing countries. There is dire need for urgent action by the world community. The peoples of Africa are struggling to free themselves from the curses of poverty and hunger, and the rest of the world must help them in this struggle.
The vital element of developing traditional agriculture has been sorely neglected. Israel is now preparing an aid proposal for more efficient food delivery systems that would provide better nutrition and would link such aid with land and water development programs.
The success of integrated rural development has been proved in Israel's own rapid agricultural development. Israel has much experience in the proper use of soil and water, marketing organization, agro-industrial systems appropriate for developing countries, and the integration of populations and development projects. He are ready to share our know-how in these fields with other developing countries. The benefits of this experience can contribute to raising living standards in many societies.	4
Israel has presented to international organizations, both within and outside the United Nations, a development proposal entitled ""Transitional Economy"". It seeks to break the vicious circle of poverty by improving the productivity and quality of life in developing countries. The proposed program seeks to combine a comprehensive development process with decentralized planning and implementation.
In the 26 years of Israel's involvement in international development efforts, Israel has co-operated with more than 100 countries and trained over 50,000 men and women in agriculture, in rural development and in health and education. During Israel's development it encountered some of the same problems that are now facing African countries and has successfully overcome them.
The United Nations may recapture some of its prestige and authority if it gives priority to these pressing social and economic issues. The magnitude of the tasks before us will require unprecedented international co-operation.
Unfortunately, the United Nations record is not very encouraging. At its last session the General Assembly had 143 items on its agenda. It passed no less than 38 resolutions relating to the Middle East, out of which 37 were negative, even hostile, in their reference to Israel. Such resolutions have long ceased to attract any attention or carry any weight. Yet the General Assembly did not see fit to address itself to such danger-spots as the Iraq-Iran war and Afghanistan, or to many of the socio-economic problems which plague our society.
Let us put aside the political differences that beset our world and join forces in an effort to find solutions for the ordinary man, woman and child, who are too often ignored in the heat of political debate. Let us work together in the spirit of the ancient prophets who gave to the world the concept of the brotherhood of man, a concept which has been the basis for the great ideals of mankind.
In the present age of unprecedented opportunities, Israel calls upon all Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations to rise to the challenge offered by science and technology. Let us share the fruits of scientific and technological advances to improve our lives. Let us build a moral and prosperous future to achieve justice and dignity for all. Let the United Nations become, truly, a ""United Nations for a better world""."
5,1996,"ISR_prev_1998","Allow
me first, Sir, to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his
unanimous election as President of the General Assembly
at its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. I
would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas
do Amaral, for the outstanding manner in which he carried
out his duties.
The succession of Governments, which is a defining
principle of Israeli democracy, has recently brought to
power a new Government in Israel. A section of the
international community has deemed this democratic Israeli
choice impertinent, suggesting that it would work against
regional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like to
make a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest for
peace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekers
on one side and mischief-makers and people who reject
peace on the other. In Israel, those on the left and right
converge in their quest for peace, their sensibilities and
differences notwithstanding.
I wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arab
peace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regarding
the practice of peace in Israel and to show that the new
majority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achieve
peace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a founding
landmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. The
Madrid Conference, to which I had the honour of
contributing, also bears the special stamp of the pioneers of
peace, to whose achievements the new majority in Israel are
the direct heirs.
The firm commitment of the Netanyahu Government
with respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to the
peace process, which our immediate neighbours, Egypt and
Jordan, helped to shape. However, my Government’s swift
engagement in the peace process has been minimized,
reduced and distorted. The meetings that the Prime
Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel
and I have had with the Chairman of the Palestinian
Authority have been met with sarcasm and given only
secondary importance. Those meetings dealt precisely
with the substance and the content of peace. They
initiated the ways and means necessary for the
achievement of peace. They amplified the resonance of
the Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinian
recognition to new sections of society and Israeli political
classes. It is Israel’s determination to reach peace
according to the policies and fundamental guidelines of
the new Government.
On its road to peace, the Government of Israel is
guided by several principles, which I would like to
expound. For us, security is neither an obsession nor a
blind belief. It touches upon our very existence in a
region where, unfortunately, threats and instability still
rage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architecture
of peace. It cannot, under any circumstances, tag along
behind a process in which terrorism and violence have not
yet spoken their last word.
Negotiations themselves, through their joint creative
energies, allow us to control the dangers and drifts. The
battle against terrorism and its infrastructures and its
sources of financing and assistance is not only for us to
fight. We solemnly call upon the United Nations
relentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggle
against terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. It
is imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process free from violence.
I have just returned from the Washington summit,
held at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf of
the Government and the people of Israel, I wish, from this
rostrum, to thank the President and the Secretary of State
of the United States for their exemplary contribution to
peace by bringing the parties together and for their
profound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.
In this respect the role and contribution of the United
States remain of great importance.
On Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams will
convene again in an attempt to resolve their differences in
respect of the various agreements. We are responsible to
our people and to our whole region in this matter. We
must therefore display good faith and mutual
understanding in order to fulfil our mission, and to send
out the message of stable peace and lasting security.
12


The Washington summit reconfirmed the principles
and guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myself
wholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-
to-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are the
key to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and the
renunciation of violence: these represent the very basis of
mutual efforts for peace.
The choice is in our hands. Will we opt for
cooperation, progress, real peace and security? Or will we
revert to the dark days of conflict, confrontation and
violence, thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part,
Israel has chosen hope.
Another major principle in our search for peace is the
will of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.
Regional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peace
and stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economic
hegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation of
regional cooperation. This is a basic principle of
normalization. Peace and normalization are one and
indivisible. Consequently, if we are to follow the logic of
peace and dialogue, we cannot risk having normalization
taken hostage and brought to a halt.
Israel makes no secret that normalization of its
relations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.
This means comprehensive political and economic relations,
and the broadest possible intellectual, cultural and spiritual
acceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as a
body foreign to the region. Normalization must erase
forever the residue of this ideological negation.
Normalization is the indispensable cement for keeping
together the edifice of peace.
One of our immediate goals is the resumption of
negotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madrid
principles, which inaugurated the dialogue between the two
countries. We recognize Syria’s important role in the
establishment of lasting peace in our region. From this
rostrum, we call upon President Al-Assad to resume
negotiations.
As to Lebanon, we have no territorial disputes with
Lebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanon
can be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence and
the building of peace.
Egypt and its President, Mr. Hosni Mubarak, are our
partners in peace. They are the authors and actors that have
always been engaged in all stages of the peace process.
Jordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in the
building of peace in our region. A man of peace and
dialogue, His Majesty King Hussein has actively
supported the peace process and has provided a vital
guarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyed
his complete support.
On the long path to peace, the country of Morocco,
the country of my birth and family roots, has always
walked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arab
reconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty King
Hassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-
Israeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue his
essential role and breathe into peace the remarkable
inspiration of his solidarity.
I would like to pay tribute also to the active support
of Tunisia. Oman, Qatar and, more recently, Mauritania
have all helped to consolidate peace efforts.
The peace process has benefitted from the
considerable support of the co-sponsors, the United States
and Russia, and from the active and positive contribution
of the European Union and Norway and of Powers such
as Japan and Canada.
Once again, I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’s
irreversible commitment and determination to pursue the
path of peace.
Since the dawn of history our region has been a
meeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures, a
vibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At the
crossroads of continents and countries, the Middle East
must, in times of peace, discover again the genius of this
place and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabs
and Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom to
regenerate their vocation as the promoters of life and
humanity.
Through international cooperation, Israel is sharing
with young countries from Africa to Asia, from Latin
America to China, its achievements and assets in the
fields of agriculture, health and science.
We hope that the day will come when a regional
security system will be established in the Middle East to
provide a cooperative multilateral response to all security
problems. The advantage of this regional approach is that
it is based on direct negotiations between the States of the
region. The first stage is to build confidence, and
thereafter we must put arms control and disarmament
13


mechanisms into place. For this reason, Israel welcomed the
establishment of the Arms Control and Regional Security
Working Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hope
that in the future this framework will encompass all States
of the Middle East.
Israel’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to set
ambitious objectives, and to pursue them pragmatically and
realistically. After peace and reconciliation have been
established among all the States of the region, Israel will
endeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as
ballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected to
rigorous verification.
Negotiations to establish such a zone will commence
following the signing of bilateral peace accords between
Israel and all the countries of the region. In the meantime
Israel will implement confidence-building measures that
will increase openness and transparency and, thereby, make
a contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armed
conflict.
We generally prefer regional security arrangements.
However, Israel is in favour of the implementation of
certain aspects of international mechanisms for arms control
and disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly, Israel
signed the Convention on conventional weapons and
adopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export of
anti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treaty
against the use of chemical weapons and now the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel will
consider ratification of that Treaty depending upon
developments in the region, particularly the adoption of that
Treaty by the major countries.
Israel has thus demonstrated its determination to be
involved, whenever possible, in the efforts of the
international community to prevent the spread of
conventional and non-conventional weapons.
Israel strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledged
member of the family of nations represented in this
Organization. We note with regret and deep disappointment
that the question of our membership in a regional group has
still not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the right
available to all States Members of the United Nations to
participate on an equal footing in all its activities. This
impairs the principle of equality among sovereign nations
under the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that this
injustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be able
to act within this Organization on the same footing as all
other Member States.
It is with the subject of Jerusalem, whose very name
is invoked in so many prayers for peace, that I wish to
conclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three great
religions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting and
ensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expression
for all believers. It is an entirely shared religious reality
to which Israel has made a profound contribution.
Jerusalem, the horizon of our dreams and prayers,
has throughout our exile and dispersions constituted the
summit of our collective being. Capital of Israel, both in
ancient and modern times, never has Jerusalem been the
capital of any country other than Israel.
Rarely if ever has any sovereign State been denied
the right to freely determine its capital. Israel, the people
of peace restored to sovereignty after 2,000 years of exile,
has returned to the city of peace, Yerushalayim:
Jerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswerving
devotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm of
peace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shall
tirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace.




"
5,1997,"ISR_prev_1998","I would like to begin by
congratulating the President on his unanimous election to
preside over the fifty-second session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations. It is my hope that at this
session the Assembly will be successful in bringing nations
closer to each other and in finding ways to address the
challenges that face all countries and nations, north and
south, east and west.
I also wish to congratulate his predecessor,
Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for the manner in
which he carried out his duties.
We mark this year the twentieth anniversary of the
peace initiative of the late Prime Minister of Israel,
Menachem Begin, and the late President of Egypt, Anwar
Sadat. Those leaders, with their historic decision and their
courageous leadership, pioneered the way towards the first
peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour, Egypt.
Throughout their entire history, the people of Israel
have aspired to live in peace. Together with our constant
call for peace with our neighbours, we have not spared any
effort to seek, whether through direct or indirect contacts,
a partner in this effort. Today, too, we continue to seek
channels for dialogue and to build bridges to peace.
In recent years, since 1991, after the principles for
negotiating peace in the Middle East were laid down at
Madrid, we have achieved a number of important
advances with the establishment of full peace between
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the
signing of interim accords with the Palestinians.
Nevertheless, the road to full peace is still long, and
negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria and
Lebanon still lie ahead of us.
Immediately after the last elections, the Government
of Israel accepted the need to continue to advance the
Oslo accords and has acted to implement them. In the
past year we have spared no effort to implement those
accords, but, unfortunately, the trust that is the lifeblood
of the entire process has been undermined as a result of
the failure of the Palestinians to carry out their
commitments according to the agreements they have
signed.
In the past year, while pursuing these efforts, we
have endured many tests and have suffered ongoing
terrorist attacks and bloodshed. Our deep-rooted aspiration
for peace, security and tranquillity has been stained by the
shedding of innocent blood, by the murder of men,
women and children cut down by barbaric terrorist
attacks. Yet despite our deep sorrow and mourning over
the loss of those innocent lives, the hope for peace has
not been extinguished in the hearts of the citizens of
Israel.
The citizens of Israel have taken upon themselves
great risks for peace, but there is none among them who
is willing to continue to pay the bloody price that is being
demanded in the name of peace. We must break this
tragic and violent cycle. It is only through joint action in
confronting the terror that trust will be re-established and
the doubts regarding intentions be removed.
As I stated in my remarks at the fifty-first session of
this Assembly, all Israel is united in its deep desire for
peace and for a life of calm and security. In Israel, both
right and left are united in this quest.
If trust can be restored, if the principle of reciprocity
is honoured, it will be possible for us to proceed. We
have already proved our willingness to do so, through our
decisions and actions since taking office and in the
signing and implementation of the Hebron agreement in
all its aspects.
Peace cannot live side by side with continued
incitement, hostility, violence and terror. Peace means, in
essence, the unequivocal and irreversible abandonment of
25


violence. Dialogue, negotiation, compromise and the
honouring of agreements — those are the path to peace.
These principles apply throughout the world and must
apply also in the Middle East. The existence of two parallel
tracks, one on which negotiations are pursued while a
second track of violence, terror and bloodshed continues
unimpeded, is totally unacceptable. This is a direct
challenge and affront to the very concept of peace.
Terror does not suddenly erupt from nowhere. It is not
a spontaneous phenomenon. Too often we have seen
terrorist leaders and their organizations adopt the facade of
innocent and peaceful organizations, charitable and welfare
organizations, while under this cover they contribute to the
preparation and perpetration of vicious terrorist attacks.
Terror can be likened to a volcano ready to erupt at any
moment, whose boiling lava threatens to destroy all who lie
in its path.
Those who resort to terror are seeking not only to kill
Israelis but also to hurt their own brethren. Terror cannot be
accepted as a legitimate tool for resolving differences. It
must be rejected, absolutely and unequivocally, and it must
be fought unrelentingly. We will not agree to live under its
constant threat.
The words of the President of the United States and of
the Foreign Minister of Russia at this Assembly just a few
days ago are important and should guide us all in this
matter. I quote President Clinton when he spoke from this
very rostrum:
“terrorism is always a crime and never a justifiable
political act.” [See Official Records of the General
Assembly, Fifty-second Session, Plenary Meetings, 5th
meeting]
Thus, the international community bears the responsibility
for ensuring that terrorism enjoys no political support,
recognition or legitimacy, not even implicitly.
In the 1993 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority
and Arafat, its leader, undertook in the name of the
Palestinian people to fight terrorism. They reaffirmed this
commitment again in the 1995 Interim Agreement, again
one year ago at the Washington summit and again in the
Hebron agreement. Much to our consternation, it has been
proved that this commitment has not been upheld as
required, thus causing the present crisis of confidence.
Israel stands firmly upon its call to the Palestinian
Authority to fulfil its promise to fight relentlessly against
terror. The Authority must act jointly and in full
cooperation with us against terrorism and violence. We
seek neither to dictate nor to coerce. We seek merely the
implementation of signed agreements. The fight against
terror, in our humble opinion, is also in the Palestinian
interest.
In response to the repeated crises in the process
caused by the failure of the Palestinian Authority to live
up to its commitments, Israel proposes a binding code of
conduct for relations between us. This code should
include, first, the rejection of violence as a means for
achieving political goals; secondly, preservation of the
framework of direct negotiations and agreement to refrain
from attempts to transfer disputes and negotiations onto
the international stage; thirdly, the institutionalization of
permanent channels of communication, including in times
of crisis; fourthly, a cessation of incitement and the call
to violence and jihad, and their replacement with the
language of reconciliation and mutual respect; and, fifthly,
the advancement and encouragement of normalization and
support for regional activities.
The purpose of this code of conduct is to facilitate
uninterrupted negotiations and crisis management, and to
create an atmosphere of dialogue. This code must respond
to the sensitivities and needs of both sides. We believe
that the adoption of the above principles will allow us to
overcome the present crisis and help in preventing future
ones as the negotiations proceed. These rules of the game
will also contribute to renewed trust between the leaders
and greater confidence between the peoples.
In the wake of the visit to the Middle East of the
United States Secretary of State, renewed agreement has
been reached to continue the efforts at restoring the peace
process to its proper track. We have been conducting
intensive talks in recent days, with the assistance of the
United States, both in Washington and here, with a view
to resuming the negotiations and advancing our efforts to
reach a permanent settlement with the Palestinians.
Israel values and appreciates the action of the United
States Secretary of State and her commitment and efforts
to extricate the peace process from its current impasse, to
bring the parties closer together and to ensure the success
of the negotiations. We are fully committed to these
efforts.
26


Israel reaffirms its proposal to conduct accelerated
negotiations, according to an agreed timetable, on
permanent status. We propose conducting negotiations in
which the sides will agree upon the desired outcomes and
the way towards achieving them. This proposal is intended
to hasten the attainment of a peaceful settlement, not to
delay it. This is also our call and our proposal to the
Palestinian Authority.
The international community can play an important
role in facilitating the dialogue between the sides, which
will make it possible for us to resolve our differences
through direct negotiations. It is only through direct
negotiations that we can bring this process to a successful
conclusion. One-sided international declarations, dictates or
pressures will not help. Attempts to internationalize the
dispute and to transfer the arena of negotiations to the
United Nations and other international forums only serve to
create unnecessary obstacles and to make already
entrenched positions more rigid.
The comprehensive peace we yearn for will not be
achieved until we reach peace agreements with Syria and
Lebanon. It is imperative to reach understandings and
agreement that will enable us to renew negotiations and to
resolve all the matters at issue between us. We expect to
find in Syria and its leadership a partner in the search for
a just peace. If Syria has indeed made a strategic choice in
favour of peace — the “peace of the brave”, as claimed by
its leadership — then we must explore together every
possible avenue, at any place and at any time, for renewing
the talks between us.
Israel cannot accept the continued violence and terror
on its northern border. The terrorist activities of
organizations such as Hezbollah and the fear of Katyusha
rockets and attacks upon our cities and towns bear the
threat of ongoing regional tension and continued bloodshed.
There is no territorial dispute between Israel and Lebanon.
We wish to see a sovereign, free and independent Lebanon
acting determinedly against the terrorist organizations that
operate from its territory.
If we are to reach peace, we cannot make do only
with agreements and contracts. The reality of peace means
normalization, open borders, freedom of movement,
commerce and cooperation for the benefit of the entire
region. These are the soul and essence of peace.
Normalization is not a prize or a gift for Israel alone.
The decisions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab
League at their recent meeting in Cairo, just over one week
ago, stand in direct contradiction to the aspirations for
peace and undermine its foundations. The attempts to
prevent normalization with Israel, to freeze the level of
existing relations with it, to close liaison and interests
offices between Israel and Arab neighbours and to
reactivate the Arab boycott add up, in practice, to a
boycott of peace itself. This is a destructive policy which
is reversing the process.
The ongoing and intentional freeze of the
multilateral talks also has a deleterious effect on the
entrenchment of peace. The multilateral talks were meant
and should serve as a platform and incentive for building
peace. We must promote the bilateral and multilateral
channels alike and not make one conditional upon the
other, nor create further obstacles and barriers on the road
to peace. The question mark hanging over the regional
economic conference scheduled to take place later this
year in Doha, Qatar, is further evidence of this negative
drive.
The countries of the Middle East that are party to
the peace effort have a common interest in regional
stability and the advancement of prosperity and well-
being for all the nations of the region. We face together
the growing shortage of water and the ever-expanding
desert. We are also facing dangers from within our region
that threaten to undermine the stability of the regimes of
various nations and to plunge the entire region into
violence, war and bloodshed.
It was only a few years ago that the entire world
was forced into forming a coalition to combat an
aggressive dictator who sought to conquer a neighbouring
country and to terrorize our entire region. Today, we face
new and even more extreme dangers, but the lessons of
recent experience have not been learned and many
countries turn a blind eye to the threat.
The leadership of Iran continues to speak in terms
that threaten the State of Israel and call for its destruction.
Yet the international community continues to remain deaf
and refuses to speak out against Iran's policies,
declarations and actions.
Iran's efforts, like those of Iraq, to acquire
operational weapons of mass destruction of all kinds
represent the greatest threat to security and stability in the
Middle East and beyond. The ramifications of Iran's
weapons programme extend far beyond the geographical
confines of our region. They threaten the security of other
27


members of the international community and their interests.
Israel reiterates its call to the members of the
international family of nations — and at their head the
United States, Russia and the members of the European
Union and of the Commonwealth of Independent States —
to exercise the full weight of their influence and to take
concrete steps to prevent this development, which
represents a threat to the existence of the State of Israel.
After the establishment, as we hope, of peace treaties
between Israel and every country of the region, it will be
possible to create a regional security system that would
provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of
security problems in the Middle East, including a mutually
and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. These
are our goals and we must act to achieve them.
Israel is an active and responsible member of the
family of nations represented in this body. However, 50
years after the United Nations adopted, on 29 November
1947, the resolution calling for the establishment of the
State of Israel, we are still denied our equal rights in this
Organization.
We attach great importance to the fundamental reform
of the United Nations work. We also share the opinion of
other United Nations Member countries that believe that the
Organization urgently requires greater efficiency and a
redirecting of its valuable but limited resources towards its
truly important tasks. At the same time, we are convinced
that no reform can be completed so long as the question of
Israel's membership of a regional group remains unresolved.
We call upon this Organization to correct this anomaly.
Much to our chagrin, in the last year we have seen an
intensification of the political campaign waged against
Israel at the United Nations. This campaign only impedes
the peace process and further undermines confidence
between the parties. We call upon the Member States to
refrain from lending their support to such resolutions. The
time has come for this Assembly to reduce the number of
resolutions on the Middle East that it adopts each year and
to contribute positively to creating an atmosphere conducive
to direct negotiations between the parties.
As part of Israel's international and regional
commitment and of its credo as a State, we are engaged in
cooperative programmes with many countries, with which
we share the experience and knowledge we have acquired
in various fields. Israel attaches great importance to its
international cooperation programme and to assisting
various peoples to address the challenges of development
and the hazards of nature, hunger and disease.
Over more than three decades, tens of thousands of
trainees have participated in courses in Israel and in their
own countries within the framework of Israel's
cooperation and assistance programme in the fields of
education, health, agriculture, industry, social affairs and
leadership. We are especially proud of the participation in
recent years of trainees from Arab countries, amongst
them Palestinians. These trainees are emissaries of
goodwill, ambassadors of peace, who bear with them the
message and the great hope of human well-being. As in
the words of the prophet:
“Each shall help his neighbour and make him
strong”.
This year, the Jewish people in Israel and around the
world marks the jubilee of its national revival. Fifty years
ago, the Jewish people restored its national sovereignty in
its ancient homeland. Throughout the dark days of our
2,000-year dispersion, we dreamt of the day that we
would renew our national life in the land of our
forefathers, the land of Israel.
It is the privilege of our generation to fulfil this
aspiration. The Jewish people has returned and built up its
land. The Jewish people is once again gathering in its
ancient home and has succeeded in building a vibrant
and democratic society, a flourishing economy, science,
research and industry.
For the past 50 years, we have laboured to ensure
Israel's security and independence, while always seeking
peace and good-neighbourly relations in our region. Fifty
years on, the State of Israel is an irremovable reality.
This week, we mark the beginning of the Jewish
new year. At this holy time, every Jew turns his eye
towards the heavens with a prayer in his heart for the
peace of the world, the end of misery and a new dawn of
hope for all. On this day of remembrance, the blow of the
shofar is accompanied by the prayer:
“may the year and its troubles pass and a new year
and its blessings begin”.




"
5,1971,"ISR_prev_1998","60.	 Mr. President, you come to the leadership of the General Assembly at a time when eastern Asia stands in the center of international concern. It is in that region alone that war still rages day by day. It is there that a burden of suffering, unparalleled elsewhere, weighs heavily on the conscience of mankind. And it is to Asia that our eyes will turn when we come to take decisions on the future of this Organization and the principles underlying its structure.
61.	It is right at such a time that an Asian statesman of high capacity and repute should preside over our deliberations. Israel wishes you success and pledges itself to your support. You will be fortified by the high example of your eminent predecessor, Edvard Hambro of Norway, and by the experience and patient skill of the Secretary-General, who is completing a full decade of service to the international cause.
62.	Last year the United Nations marked its twenty-fifth anniversary by an act of celebration. I suggested then that the occasion could have been more wisely used for scrutiny and self-criticism (1851st meeting]. There is a manifest decline in the influence of the General Assembly on the main issues affecting human welfare and destiny. Its resonance has diminished. The central currents of international life and policy flow outside its walls. The frustration arises, not so much from defects in the Organization's work, as from discord and contention amongst the Powers. Yet there are some causes which lie within our capacity of correction. I shall mention one.
63.	In the work of the United Nations there is a strong accent on public controversy and a relative neglect of private conciliation. A report by the Secretary-General 11 years ago contained a plea to give greater emphasis to the United Nations as an instrument for negotiation of settlements as distinct from this world debate of issues. The advice was not heeded. Debate, not negotiation, still dominates the United Nations practice. Resolutions are adopted in great numbers, but their texts bear witness to the parliamentary advantages of fragmentation rather than to a balanced view of rights or realities.
64.	For example: in a dispute in the Middle East between two parties one of which has a single vote and the other 16 or, in practice 40, the preordained triumph of automatic majorities has no moral value, little practical effect and a very short life in the world's memory. The same is true of the Security Council, a third of whose members have their diplomatic relations and their ethnic or sentimental predilections exclusively on one side.
65.	This difficulty would not exist if the organs of the United Nations would regard it as their main function to seek consensus which would include the interested parties. They would be better employed in encouraging agreement between the parties at issue, than in sharpening controversy between them by attempts at adjudication. In short, the United Nations should aspire to a diplomatic rather than to a parliamentary role. The test of achievement should be not how many resolutions we have voted but how many solutions we have advanced.
66.	And, indeed, wherever free, direct negotiation has taken place across the world in the past year there has been fruitful issue. There have been the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union and Poland with the Federal Republic of Germany, based, as Mr. Gromyko significantly told us, ""on recognition of European realities, especially on the inviolability of frontiers"" [1942nd meeting, para. 101]. He was referring to the frontiers established after the war by negotiation and agreement. There has been the four-Power agreement on Berlin where, as Mr. Gromyko again correctly said, it is now up to the two parties directly concerned ""to complete the negotiations between them"" [ibid., para. 98]. There has been the normalization of relations between Czechoslovakia and the Federal Republic of Germany. There has been direct contact between the United States and the People's Republic of China, to be followed at an early date by a meeting at the highest level of responsibility. The Paris talks on Viet-Nam, with the direct participation of all the parties at issue, have been accompanied by a constant de-escalation of the fighting. There is grave tension between India and Pakistan, as is evident from the general debate here earlier this week; but the two Governments have direct relations which they ca« apply to the solution of their differences. Many hearts are heavy at the reports coming from the boundary between Ireland and
Northern Ireland; but there is also news that the heads of Government concerned have met each other and agreed on a process of political reconciliation. In Washington, agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union are being signed today for modernizing the ""hot line"" and strengthening safeguards against accidental war.
67.	Is there no lesson to be drawn from the settlements reached and attempted this year? Surely they show that the air is alive with a spirit of innovation. Attitudes of hostility which once seemed to be an organic part of our generation's life are now yielding to a strong impulse for peaceful settlement. Above all we are learning lessons about the immense importance of communication. Time and again the decision of Governments to abandon their cold separation and make contact with each other develops from a procedural advance into a change of substantive positions and thence into binding agreements. The central themes of international life in 1971 are direct contact, the abandonment of traditional conflicts, and flexible, pragmatic negotiation.
68.	There is also a move away from dogmatic attachment to documents. If old formulas and texts have reached deadlock, new ones are sought. There is a particular recognition that after wars the need is to build new systems of relations and not to reproduce the conditions and situations out of which war erupted. This new empiricism affects the juridical domain as well. Governments which seriously seek peace do not hesitate to confer directly with Governments which they do not yet recognize and with which they have no legal relations,
69.	If there is frustration in the Middle East it is because our region is still the exception to all the positive rules which have been applied elsewhere. Whatever is tried successfully in other regions is avoided in the Middle East. Here alone there is still no contact between the parties at issue. Here alone the Governments which will have to live side by side with each other have still not come face to face at a table of negotiation. Here alone we are often told that the only way to get peace is to restore the situations which erupted in war. Here alone it is said in many places that the resumption of an important peace mission is wholly dependent on a single memorandum on which there is deadlock, and that there is no room for any innovation or any versatility of formulas and techniques.
70.	It is true, despite these failures, that the situation in the Middle East today is less explosive than a year ago. The flow of events has not been backward. The cease-fire along the Suez Canal has been effective, with rare and isolated exceptions, for 14 months. Israel does not propose to bring it to an end and Egypt would achieve nothing by violating it. Indeed, the only certainty in the Middle East is that resumed hostilities would serve no interest and advance no settlement. The absence of fighting along the Suez Canal line has released the Middle East and the world from the daily prospect of escalation involving the Soviet forces which were irresponsibly introduced into the' region with the effect of aggravating and enlarging a local tension. There has been a sharp decline in the strength and prestige of the terrorist groups and the pirate organizations that loomed so large a year ago. There has been peaceful movement across open bridges into Israel and the administered territories of scores of thousands of Arabs from neighboring Arab countries which are officially ""at war"" with Israel. Thus new patterns of coexistence have grown up between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs in daily life and work. Side by side with a violent and incendiary Arab rhetoric there seem to be here and there some beginnings of a greater realism in Arab thinking on the problem of Israel's sovereignty and Israel's deep roots in the life and history of the Middle East. Finally, there are three separate availabilities of good offices which, although not all in active course today, are mutually accepted by the parties: the Jarring mission; the good offices of the United States in pursuit of an agreement concerning the Suez Canal; and the intention of ten African Presidents to authorize four eminent heads of State to go to Jerusalem and Cairo on a mission of information and goodwill.
71.	Yet, with all these consolations the peace efforts are not sufficiently intense. The talks under Ambassador Jarring's auspices, which began in high promise in January, have been at a standstill since the end of February. An exchange of views and positions on a special Suez Canal agreement was inaugurated through the good offices of the United States in April. This effort is still underway, but its pace is slow. In discussing the obstacles to peace it would be easy, but sterile, to fall into recrimination. Nothing would be easier. One of the few things that all Members of the United Nations have in common is the ability to discuss each other's imperfections. Yet what mankind longs to hear is not how deadlocks arose, but how it is proposed to overcome them. The general debate will be well used if Middle Eastern States will give precise definition to what they are prepared to do in order to bring a peaceful settlement into view. All who seek an understanding of Israel's policies must come face to face with two elements in the national mood. There is a sharp preoccupation with security; and there is a vivid memory of the horror and dark peril from which we emerged four years ago.
72.	In reflecting on the theme of security, Israel cannot easily forget the immense loss and burden it has borne through the hostility directed against it for over two decades. Our danger, in 1967 was the climax, but not the whole story, of our predicament. No other people has had to live all its days with a mark of interrogation hanging over its collective and individual survival. Israel's insistence on genuine and stable security takes particular depth from the hideous legacy of Jewish massacre in the European slaughter-house. No people in history has undergone an experience of such tragic depth and scope. And no other State has grown for 23 years amidst such a comprehensive effort to deny it every breath of life.
73.	In particular, Israel's mind preserves a permanent and,, unfading image of the danger and solitude from which it emerged in the summer of 1967. To forget or ignore these memories is to renounce all true understanding of the Middle Eastern reality today. It was only by exceptional vigilance and cruel sacrifice that we repelled a monstrous design that would have ended our people's historic journey and cast all Israel's life and achievement into the flames. Maritime blockade, terrorist incursions, military encirclement, declarations of overt war, a frenzied torrent of threats and a formal announcement from Cairo that the battle was joined for Israel's destruction all these came
together in cumulative assault,""We recall the outrageous silence and apathy with which the Security Council, between one adjournment and the next, calmly observed the only attempt in modern history to wipe a sovereign State off the map of the world. Mr. Gromyko indulges his sense of humour when he tells us that guarantees by the Security Council are among ""the firmest guarantees that can be imagined in the modern world"" [ibid.., para. 135], The truth has Iden and is that, largely as a result of Soviet policy, the Security Council for 20 years has refused to defend any Israeli right including the right not to have its citizens killed, its ports blockaded, its existence threatened. The policy of the Security Council has been to refuse to adopt any decision of which a single word is unpalatable to the Arab Governments. It has thus surrounded every assault on Israeli lives, Israeli rights and Israeli security with indulgence. At the highest point of tension and of Israel's danger in May 1967, with Israel blockaded and encircled on every side, with all mankind gripped by the apprehension of approaching war, the suggestion of the Soviet Union was that the Security Council should go home and refuse to discuss such an ""artificial"" matter as the declaration of active war and the formal imposition of a blockade against a Member State. It is largely because of Soviet policy that the Security Council cannot be a guarantor of any Israeli rights. And the future development in the composition of the Security Council, however essential for other reasons, is bound to emphasize its inability to guarantee or even to express an Israeli interest, whatever the majority of its members may think or say.
74.	There are few effective guarantees of peace beyond those inherent in the nature of the peace itself. The greatest danger is lest through lassitude of spirit or impatience or imprecision of diplomatic craftsmanship we again revert to fragile, false and ambiguous solutions, which carry in them the seed of future wars.
75.	But the work of peace, however complex, must be attempted. Israel's deepest aspiration is to take part in a new deployment of energies in the service of a peaceful order of relations in the Middle East. Accordingly I ask the crucial questions: Is the slow rhythm of the peace efforts inevitable? Can nothing be done or at least attempted to set some dialog in swifter motion? Do Israel's policies offer openings through which roads to peace can be discerned and actively explored? My answer is that if the Arab States, and especially Egypt, sincerely desire an honorable and lasting peace, there are many roads leading to that goal.
76.	The first road lies in a Suez Canal agreement. There are many reasons for giving priority to this at attempt. A sudden transition from a conflict of more than two decades to a total settlement has proved difficult. It may be more rational to expect progress by stages. Each stage would bring about a solution of a specific problem while opening the way to further agreements and thus to final peace.
77.	The Suez Canal sector calls urgently for disengagement. It is there that the regional tension is compounded by the military presence of a great Power. Disengagement of forces here is an urgent international interest.
78.	The President of Egypt proposed on 4 February an attempt to open the Suez Canal ahead of a total settlement.
Israel's Prime Minister responded on 9 February. Both Governments subsequently agreed that the United States should use its good offices to explore the prospect. We therefore have an agreed objective and an agreed modality. , We believe that the effort to bridge the gulf between the positions of the parties should be pursued in the general interest of peace. If agreement cannot be reached on such a clearly defined issue in which Egyptian advantage is so strong it would appear to be even more difficult to advance in one step towards an over-all settlement in which all the complex issues would Ml into place. But the contrary is also true. A concrete result in this matter will accelerate and inspire negotiation and agreements on other issues. The peace effort will acquire momentum. It will be surrounded for the first time by an air of confidence and promise.
79.	Having been invited to give its views on this matter, Israel developed a proposal that an arrangement be agreed upon with a view to the opening of the Suez Canal to be cleared and operated by Egypt. Israel would make a withdrawal of its forces from the water-line to an agreed distance. The fighting would not be resumed. Egypt would clear and open the Canal. It would be agreed that there be free passage for all ships and cargoes, including those of Israel. Effective and agreed supervision procedures would be established. Means of deterrence against the danger of violation of the agreement would be assured. The agreement would stand on its own feet, but it would not affect or annul the undertakings which the parties gave in August 1970 to hold discussions under Ambassador Jarring's auspices in conformity with his mandate under Security Council resolution 242(1967). The line to be held by Israeli forces in accordance with that Canal agreement would not be considered final. When agreement on a final boundary is reached in the framework of the peace settlement Israeli forces will withdraw to it.
80.	We hope that Egypt will give this proposal the detailed and careful consideration which seemed to be its intention in April. It represents far-reaching concessions on Israel's part. It involves a movement from the cease-fire line ahead of peace. It mitigates the accepted legitimate principle that no withdrawal need take place ahead of a contractual and mutually agreed peace. The prestige, benefits and revenues from the Canal, the possible return of three quarters of a million people who live near the Canal in peaceful times, as well as the crossing of the Canal by Egyptian civilian personnel, would all be Egyptian, not Israeli, gains. A new impetus would be given to the Jarring mission, which is now in abeyance. The undertakings which I have given refute the idoa that the Canal agreement would be the last word. On the contrary, its conclusion and observance would create a favorable channel for further agreements.
81.	It is true that neither Egypt nor Israel would attain its final objective in this interim framework, but Egypt's right to present its claims in the over-all peace negotiations would remain intact, as would Israel's freedom to present its own proposals and reservations.
82.	A second road to peace lies through the resumption of negotiations under Ambassado. Jarring's auspices. Israel agreed to resume these talks in January 1971 despite Egypt's refusal to rectify its violation of the missile- standstill agreement. At a meeting with the Prime Minister and myself in January, Ambassador Jarring was requested to communicate to the Governments of Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon a list of principles which, in our view, should be embodied in the peace agreements to be concluded and signed between Israel and each of the Arab Governments concerned. These principles were, at first, vehemently ""ejected by the Egyptian Government. Subsequently, on i 5 February, the Government of Egypt commented f A/8541, annex II] on an aide-memoir submitted a week before by Ambassador Jarring [A/8541, annex I], It did not accept Mr. Jarring's precise formulations on navigation in the Suez Canal, on the Straits of Tiran, nor indeed on the definition of the scope of withdrawal. But the Egyptian reply did contain an expression of readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel provided that all the Egyptian terms for the agreement were met. One of these terms was the total withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai peninsula, the Gaza strip and all territories beyond the armistice line existing on 4 June 1967.
83.	In its reply on 26 February 1971 [A/8541, annex III] the Israel Government viewed favorably the expression by Egypt of its readiness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and reiterated that it was prepared for meaningful negotiation on all subjects relevant to a peace agreement between the two countries.
84.	Why then are the Jarring talks in abeyance? The reason is plain. The Security Council resolution, 242(1967), requires that the withdrawal and boundary clauses of the peace agreement, like all its other provisions, must be determined through agreement, which of course implies negotiation. Egypt declines to hold any dialog or negotiation whatever on this point. It lays down its own position as an ultimate condition to which Israel must submit before negotiation begins. Indeed it is not clear why negotiation would be needed at all if the Egyptian view has to be accepted in advance. In a recent declaration of which President Sadat was a signatory, three Arab Governments, including that of Egypt, reiterated that there can be no negotiation with Israel, no conciliation and no bargaining over the Palestinian issue. This is a more recent and presumably more authoritative statement of Egypt's policy than the one that Mr. Riad, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated to Mr. Jarring six months ago. Together with other declarations in the same mood and spirit, it raises the question whether the February memorandum has the significance that we chose to attach to it at that time.
85.	But on one point alone the February communication from Cairo and the Damascus tripartite statement are one: they both rule out the free, precise and detailed negotiation of the ""boundary and withdrawal questions. Our policy is that, instead of cease-fire lines or armistice lines, we should establish secure, recognized and agreed boundaries as part of the peace-making process, and withdraw our armed forces to those boundaries once they are determined. It is important to break away from the temporary and unresolved territorial concepts which have prevailed since 1948 in order to develop for the first time a permanent structure of boundaries and security agreements.
86.	There is no need to be apologetic about the doctrine that peace boundaries may be different from armistice lines. The Arab Governments wrote into the 1949 Armistice Agreements a provision stating that the armistice lines are not the final boundaries and these must be worked out by agreement in the transition to peace. We are now embarked on that transition. Israel's size and strength are smaller than those of the European Powers which insisted on secure and agreed boundaries after the Second World War; but the right to negotiate boundaries that would release Israel from a chronic and desperate vulnerability belongs to it as to every other sovereign State. In this matter we are not in a position of juridical defense.
87.	I shall summarize under three headings the reasons and justifications which give Israel the right to have negotiation on boundaries and security arrangements. The first, as I have already pointed out, is the provisional character of the lines now held as well as those which existed before. Several years before the 1967 war the Deputy Foreign Minister of Egypt correctly said: ""There is no legal boundary between Israel and Egypt but only a line that was fixed in the pursuance of the Armistice Agreement.""
88.	On 31 May 1967 the representative of Jordan said in the Security Council:
""There is an Armistice Agreement. The Agreement did not fix boundaries; it fixed a demarcation line. The Agreement did not pass judgment on rights political, military or otherwise. Thus I know of no territory; I know of no boundary."" 
89.	A second and more contemporary reason in support of Israel's claim to a negotiation on withdrawal and boundaries lies in the Security Council's resolution 242 (1967), which has been accepted by some Arab States and by Israel and which is the constitutive document of the Jarring mission. That resolution was adopted after all attempts to require a withdrawal to the 4 June armistice lines had been defeated by vote or discarded for lack of support. The term ""secure and recognized boundaries"" was an innovation in the United Nations vocabulary. It first appeared in a United States draft resolution submitted on 7 November 1967 and later embodied in a United Kingdom draft  which was presented for unanimous vote. I must state with full solemnity and knowledge that Israel's adherence to the Security Council resolution and acceptance of the Jarring mission were secured on the most explicit understanding that the resolution offered an opportunity to negotiate agreements on boundaries and withdrawal. Secretary of State Rogers stated for the United States in October 1969:
""Those boundaries were armistice lines not final political borders. The rights, claims and positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were reserved by the Armistice Agreements. The Security Council resolution neither endorses nor precludes those armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries.""
90.	In a public statement on 12 July 1970, Mr. Sisco, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, declared that he had taken an active part in the formulation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). He added:
""That resolution did not say withdrawal to the pre- June 5 lines. The resolution said the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiation between the parties.""
91.	The United Kingdom Government, which sponsored Security Council resolution 242 (1967), put itself on record on 17 November 1969, when its Foreign Secretary, Mr. Michael Stewart, was asked:
""What is the British interpretation of the wording of the 1967 resolution? Does... it... mean that the Israelis should withdraw from all territories taken in the late war? ""
He replied:
""No, Sir. That is not the phrase used in the resolution. The resolution speaks of secure and recognized boundaries. Those words must be read concurrently with the statement on withdrawal."" 
A month later, on 9 December 1969, in the House of Commons he said:
""... There is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""?
I repeat: ""... the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.""
92.	It was in the light of these clear undertakings that the Israel Government informed Mr. Jarring in August 1970 that it accepted the Security Council resolution 242 (1967) for implementation in all its parts and that on the establishment of a just and final peace in accordance with the resolution it would withdraw its forces from the cease-fire lines to secure and recognized boundaries to be determined in the negotiations.
93.	The political and juridical aspects of the questions to which I have referred are the expression^ a deeper, more concrete reality. Israel does not have a policy of expansion or annexation. In the negotiations on boundaries and withdrawals it will seek those modifications which are essential to ensure security and to prevent another war.
94.	ihe war of 1967 did not arise exclusively from the vulnerability of the armistice lines. But there is no doubt that some topographical and strategic situations were a permanent temptation to assault. If they are not corrected and adjusted Israel, on withdrawing from the cease-fire lines, would find itself again in a position of intolerable vulnerability. There could be no more horrifying error than to revert, through lack of precise and detailed negotiation, to a territorial structure and security balance capable of reproducing the peril which exploded four years ago.
95.	In the framework of a peace settlement with Egypt, Israel would withdraw from the cease-fire lines. We have never asserted that in a condition of peace it would be necessary for our troops to remain in all of the Sinai peninsula or even in most of it. But there are vital interests affecting security, peace and navigation which impel us to reserve the right to attempt in the peace negotiations to secure a contractual basis for such continued presence as is necessary to protect security and navigation. There are several juridical expressions and precedents for such an arrangement. Our emphasis is on practical security conditions, not on any particular juridical formula. The post-war map of the world is replete with instructive parallels. The peace treaties in Europe and Asia did not bring about a return to the exact military and territorial dispositions that existed before.
96.	Now Israel does not ask Egypt to accept any of its positions as a condition of negotiation. The proposal for the withdrawal of all Israeli troops to the previous positions is legitimate as an Egyptian proposal. It is equally legitimate for Israel to insist on an opportunity of free negotiation in which its own reservations and counter-proposals could be made. And our request from the world community is modest. We do not present specific Israeli proposals for endorsement by other Governments; we ask only that our right to negotiate the issues vital to our future, to our peace and to our security, should not be cut off in advance.
97.	Our position, then, is this: We have taken note of the Egyptian proposal on withdrawal. Israel would withdraw its armed forces from the Israel-United Arab Republic ceasefire line to the secure, recognized and agreed boundaries to be established in the peace agreement. Now that both parties have presented their basic positions, they should pursue their negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior condition to cover all the points I listed in their respective documents with a view to concluding a peace agreement. I continue to adhere to the view which I expressed at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly in October 1968 that
""It is possible to work out a boundary settlement compatible with the security of Israel and the honor of
Arab States	The majority of the United Nations have
recognized that the only durable and reasonable solutions are agreed solutions serving the common interests of our peoples. The new peace structure in the Middle East, including the secure and recognized boundaries, must be built by Arab and Israeli hands"" [1686th meeting, para. 111].
Thus if Egypt will present its position for negotiation without the unprecedented request for Israel's acceptance of it in advance, we shall be ready for detailed and concrete negotiation on all the matters mentioned in the Egyptian memorandum of 15 February and the Israeli document of 26 February,
98.	Effective and versatile conciliation must include a capacity to move from one direction to another in a tireless pursuit of peace. In March 1968, Ambassador Jarring suggested a formula for the convening of meetings between the parties in Nicosia on the basis of an agreed term of reference. Egypt rejected that proposal. Those concerned with the conciliation effort did not say that the mission had to be held in suspense until Egypt gave a positive reply to something which its policy did not then allow it to endorse. It would be wrong now to affirm that such a vital objective as the establishment of a negotiated peace between Israel and Egypt will never be possible except on the basis of a working paper which did not happen to secure the agreement of the parties. Egyptian-Israeli peace is too great a cause to be tied and tethered for all time to a single optional memorandum. If Egypt will agree to pursue negotiations in a detailed and concrete manner without prior conditions on all the points listed in the Israeli and Egyptian memoranda of February 1971, this road to meaningful negotiation will lie open,
99.	There are other roads to peace. The Suez Canal agreement and the discussion of an over-all settlement are not the only options available for negotiation. The problem of refugees requires a broad acceptance of regional and international responsibility. We have therefore proposed the convening of a conference of Middle Eastern States, together with Governments which have contributed to refugee relief and the specialized agencies of the United Nations, in order to chart a five-year plan for the solution of the refugee problem and the integration of refugees into productive life.
100.	This problem would now be considered against the background of some alleviating developments in recent months. There is a growing disillusion with the irredentist pretensions of the terrorist groups and the air pirates. The dividing wall which once prevented all human contact between Israelis and Palestine Arabs is falling. It is true that this is due so far to Israeli initiative. Last year not a single Israeli set foot in any Arab land, but 110,000 Arabs from countries ""at war"" with Israel came into contact with Israel across the open Jordan bridges. An open frontier between Israel and its eastern neighbor similar to the community frontiers in Europe would do much to give human reality to a peace settlement, and indeed might help the settlement to be achieved.
101.	There is a fourth possibility. The problems of boundaries and security are usually considered to be the crux of the negotiation. But there are other unresolved matters in the memoranda presented by Egypt and Israel in February. At first sight there seems to be some proximity between the peace, non-aggression, recognition and navigation clauses suggested by the two Governments. On closer inspection the disparities are substantial, and could become crucial. We suggested in January and later in March that, it might be profitable to attempt to draft some of the clauses of the Egyptian-Israel treaty relating to the principles of peace. It is an accepted negotiating technique to begin with problems in which divergences are less broad and thus to create a favorable atmosphere in which to confront the more acute problems.
102.	There is a fifth road towards negotiating procedure and activity; it concerns the negotiating procedure, but its weight is intensively substantive and not at all procedural I have said that in the early months of 1968 Ambassador Jarring suggested meetings between the parties, under his auspices, in Nicosia, in accordance with a text setting out the terms of reference for the conferences. On 10 March 1968, Ambassador Jarring informed me that Egypt had rejected that proposal. As the Secretary-General's report of 4 January 1971 reveals, Dr. Jarring ""was informed of Israel's official acceptance, without conditions, of the text"". 
103.	Now that was the negative turning-point in the history of the Jarring mission. Since then it has been limited, through Egyptian insistence, to a bizarre procedure under which Israeli documents are presented to Ambassador Jarring, and by him to the Egyptian representative. If the Israel document contains the words ""for communication to the Government of Egypt"", the Egyptian representative refuses to take it into his h?nds; or if he has inadvertently accepted its delivery, he comes back to relinquish it with panic-stricken haste as if it were a hot coal. The Israel document is then divulged by the Egyptian representative to the press, accompanied by a burst of invective. Egyptian replies are published without any hint of an intention to communicate them to Israel. The Egyptian position is that Israel may not talk to Egypt directly, may not talk to Egypt indirectly and may not communicate anything to Egypt in writing.
104.	If no other method is available my Government will communicate its views to Egypt by whatever channel or technique is possible. But we cannot conceal our conviction that there is an element of farce in the idea that the word ""negotiation"" can honestly be applied to the extraordinary procedure followed so far. How can a Government which alleges that it wants a peace agreement with Israel refuse to negotiate the terms of that agreement by a rational method of contact? To say that one is prepared to enter into a peace agreement but not to meet or negotiate even under international chairmanship is to make a mockery of the international community. One thing is clear: No international agreement has been reached on any subject between any States at any time by the methods to which the Jarring mission has so far been confined through Egypt's insistence.
105.	I am convinced that the strongest chance of breaking out of the deadlock lies in a transition to a rational negotiating procedure. The hour is ripe. The gap between the parties is wide, but may not be impossible to bridge. Negotiation is the agent which would transform the potentiality into action.
106.	One of the most important things said about the Middle East in recent days is Sir Alec Douglas-Home's statement yesterday that ""distrust... of this depth ... cannot [easily] be removed by long-distance correspondence"" [1944th meeting, para. 98] and that ""those who are in confrontation must actively help to promote a dialog'' [ibid., para, 97], If all those who hold that view would express it with equal candor, an international movement in favor of abandoning the illusion of long- range correspondence would come to effective expression.
107.	There is no weight or value in. the argument that the Arab Governments would be negotiating from weakness if they accepted direct contact under international chairmanship. Their point of reference would be, not the military situation, but the political forum in which the Arab side would speak from a position of numerical and geographical predominance,
108.	I therefore propose to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Mr. Riad, that we take our guidance from the spirit which inspires the international life of our ags. Let us meet here this month under the auspices of the United States to discuss the details and! principles of a Suez Canal settlement; or under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jarring to discuss the establishment of peace in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967) on the basis of our respective memoranda of February 1971. Let us break out of devious procedures and sterile polemics into a new vision and a new hope.
109.	In a recent statement the President of Egypt, Mr. El-Sadat, declared that he would sacrifice a million men to achieve a military victory. What he and we should be considering is how to ensure that the 33 million Egyptians, tin 3 million Israelis and the other millions in the Middle East are saved i.om sacrifice and preserved for the construction of a peaceful regional order. The task will not be served by war or by threats of renewed hostilities which command our vigilance but which are, in effect, an echo of ill-fated bombast in the recent past. Nor will our task be fulfilled by living out the rest of 1971 in ineffective debate or inflammatory resolutions. The Arab States may have enough voting strength to secure the adoption of virulent, unbalanced texts or to give a biased interpretation to the Security Council resolution, which would then cease to be an agreed documentary consensus available as a basis for the ultimate and inevitable negotiation. But what will it profit to gain an Assembly majority, but to lose Israel's adherence to a set of principles common to it and to neighboring States? The roads to peace do not have their starting point in war or in polemical debate. They branch out from one of the many avenues and by-ways of negotiation on which we shall meet Egypt when its choice is made and declared.
110.	This session could mark a recuperation in the career of ""the United Nations if the Organization made this the year of negotiation, the year of negotiation in all outstanding disputes. It has other tasks. The Second United Nations Development Decade can be saved from the frustrations of the First if the advanced countries turn aside from the perils of monetary war towards an expanding vocation in the development of emergent societies.
111.	And in the last resort this Organization will be judged according to the role it has played in defense of human welfare and dignity, The call of kinship and of dark memory will bring us to refer at appropriate stages in Committees and in the plenary meetings to two dramas of great intensity and pathos: the Jews of the Soviet Union, of whom some have reached us but of whom the great majority are still restrained from the expression of their cultural identity and their national hope; and the captive remnants of helpless Jews in Arab lands, especially in Syria, whose anguished voice cries out for liberation from terror and despair. This Organization, for all its imperfections, is still the only organized expression of the planetary spirit. It may be bearing within itself the seed of a universal order in which men will come together to save their environment from pollution, their society from disruption, their economy from decline, their life from the stress and grip of violence. There is no room for fatalistic despair. There is still time for men and nations to be, inspired by a new and spacious vision and to invest their thought and labour in defence of the ""common heritage of mankind"".



"
5,1999,"ISR_post_1998","The fifty-fourth session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations takes place
at a time marking humanity's crossing into the next
millennium. It emerges as a link in the long chain of
tumultuous events that have reshaped the map of the
family of nations.
12


The United Nations was born against the backdrop of
the destruction and desolation of the Second World War,
the most bitter, deadly and inhumane war known to
mankind. The descent of the Nazi regime to the depths of
evil was like an eclipse in the history of civilization and
will be recalled in history as a nightmare in which man
created the devil, who wreaked devastation, destruction,
terror and annihilation upon the world. The stand taken by
the Allied forces against the Nazi monster, and the creation
of the United Nations in April 1945, on the verge of the
defeat of the forces of destruction, was an act that marked
the return of humanity to its senses, to salvage the future of
mankind.
In this month when we mark 60 years since the
outbreak of the most horrible of wars, we are strengthened
more than ever in our sense of hope and confidence in the
necessity of the United Nations and of its activities
throughout the world. The various agencies of the United
Nations work to enhance world health and tend the sick; to
supply the needy with food and nourishment; to build
bridges between cultures; to promote education and
overcome ignorance; to instil hope into the lives of refugees
and displaced persons; and to assist the victims of disasters,
whether natural or man-made.
The soldiers of the United Nations forces are the true
peacekeepers of our age. In its corps are soldiers from all
the nations of the world. At times they risk their lives in
areas riddled with conflict and violence around the world,
whether their United Nations mandate is to make peace or
to be observers that safeguard the peace. These distinctions,
important as they may be to the policy makers and shapers
of international relations, have no meaning to the individual
United Nations soldier, posted far from his country, who
brings hope and tranquillity to places fraught with tragedy,
suffering and violence.
After many centuries of violence and war, of
enslavement and destructiveness in the name of murderous
ideologies, after decades of cold war and polarized world
alliances of the East and the West, the human race is now
making great strides down the paths of peace and
reconciliation. Before our very eyes, a process is
enveloping the world, signalling hope for the future.
Mankind is adopting a new path, the path of the prophet
Isaiah, who as far back as 2,600 years ago prophesied that
the day would come when
“they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more.” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4)
This prophecy — which has been adopted by the
United Nations as a source of hope, as the symbol of the
victory of the good in human beings over evil — should
serve today more than ever as a beacon and a path for all
who cherish peace around the world and for their
representatives gathered here today.
The world has become more open. Satellites, the
Internet and telecommunications networks shorten
geographical and cultural distances. The political and
ideological blocs of the past have disintegrated, and the
walls of animosity have fallen along with the tyrants and
dictators who built them. They are being replaced by new
blocs, some of which are in the process of being created
where development and prosperity reign. I hope and
believe that these beneficial transformations will also
occur in the Middle East.
In our region, too, the light of hope has been
rekindled. We are now in the midst of a political process,
the objective of which is to reach peace between States
and reconciliation between peoples. Israel aspires to reach
a comprehensive peace with its neighbours, a peace of
harmony. Israel will not be satisfied with a merely
political or strategic peace. In our eyes, the absence of
war is not the peace we aspire to achieve.
May I be allowed to emphasize once again that
peace means a culture of peace; peace means no more
threats of violence, whether implied or categorical; peace
entails the end of boycotts, the end of contempt and
defamation, the end of incitement and confrontation...
peace is also a language of peace: it is the way leaders
address their nations, teachers teach their students and
religious leaders inspire their followers.
At a time when various kinds of religious extremism
are rearing their heads and eroding human wisdom and
human freedom, it is essential that inter-faith dialogue be
strengthened and that the religions be manifested in their
enlightened forms, which sanctify tolerance and
coexistence.
On the way to achieving peace in our region, we
often find ourselves confronted with contradictory
realities. Parallel to the political process, our negotiating
partners are conducting a constant political war against
Israel in various international forums, including from the
podium of this Assembly. This dualism is inconsistent
13


with the peace process and is intolerable, as are the extreme
decisions taken by the Arab League against Israel. These
decisions are not in keeping with the spirit of peace, as
expressed in the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
We hoped for and expected a different atmosphere,
one that would complement the impetus initiated by the
new Government in Israel. We have been saddened to
witness events that undermine the essence of peace. These
events can be defined only as anti-peace resolutions.
Engaging in a peace process, on the one hand, and
maintaining anti-Israel declarations and resolutions, on the
other, raises some serious concerns about our negotiating
partners and their concept of peace. Is it a peace of
normalization with open borders, or is it only one of
temporary initial recognition? Will our relations with the
Gulf and Maghreb countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia,
Mauritania, Qatar and Oman, be allowed to expand and
develop? Or will these relations remain hostage to mood
swings after each and every difficulty in the negotiations or
whenever there is disagreement? Continued doubts about
these cardinal questions cannot be tolerated in the light of
the heavy price and grave risks that Israel is taking upon
itself in this process.
Three weeks ago, on 4 September, Israel and the
Palestinian Authority signed the Sharm el-Sheikh
Memorandum, which for the first time creates a direct,
chronological, political and conceptual link between the
Interim Agreements and the final status agreement. On 13
September, the final status talks were renewed between
Israelis and Palestinians.
We are determined to reach a framework agreement
that will form the basis of the final status agreement by
February 2000, as stated and agreed upon in the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum. In this framework we will select
the issues and set an agenda for the final status agreement.
The topics at hand are known, as are the differing vantage
points and positions of each side. The differences can be
resolved only by direct negotiations.
Regarding the final status, I wish to affirm from this
podium that when we refer to political separation as one of
the prime concepts of the permanent settlement, we are also
saying that, for the benefit of both sides, we should not
necessarily sever ties that are vital to coexistence in the
various spheres of living.
From Israel’s perspective, there is no competition and
never has been any between the different negotiating tracks.
Israel also aspires to reach peace with Syria, our
neighbour to the north. This is, after all, in the higher
common interests of both Israel and Syria. H o w e v e r ,
along with these common interests, the following point
must be made clear: A democratic country like Israel
cannot accept a precondition to beginning the talks that
requires a prior acceptance of the final outcome as
dictated by the extreme and dogged formulas of the
opposing side.
We must maintain the momentum of good will so
that we can face our children, Syrian and Israeli alike,
with a clear conscience and say to them in all honesty:
We tried everything and did our utmost. I call upon the
leaders of Syria, in view of what we have gone through
together, to cease hesitating. It is time to talk. Meetings
and discussion are not political sacrifices — they are
basic necessities.
On the road to a comprehensive peace, we wish to
see Lebanon join the camp of peacemakers. The anomaly
which has developed in its territory must come to an end.
We have never had nor do we have now any territorial
claims or disputes with Lebanon. Our one and only
interest is to guarantee the safety and security of our
citizens. I must say that, regrettably, the Government of
Lebanon has for many years failed to enforce its
sovereignty in the southern part of Lebanon and to disarm
Hezbollah. I hope that this situation will improve and that
Israel, within the framework of an agreement, will be able
to leave the southern part of Lebanon.
Nevertheless, with that as our ambition, I wish to
emphasize that we will not be held hostage much longer
on this track to a stubborn and defiant attitude. We will
make our own independent decisions, as we see fit, in
order to ensure our protection and our vital interests,
taking all options under consideration.
A reconciliation between Israel and its neighbours
must extend the promise that all the peoples of the region
may reap the benefits of peace. Normalization must not
be viewed as a one-sided gesture. As a natural outcome
of peaceful coexistence, normalization is not in the
service of one particular party. It is in the interests of all
the nations of the region.
We hope to renew the multilateral tracks as early as
this year. There is a need for close cooperation in
regional multilateral projects. Our region has tremendous
potential. In order to fully realize this potential, we must
establish a mechanism of true cooperation among the
14


States of the region. This cooperation would clearly be to
the benefit of all of us in the region.
The scarcity of water in our region, which will only
get worse, may impose a new way of life on the inhabitants
of the Middle East in the coming years. Israel is
anticipating this problem and preparing for it, but in this
case, as in others, cooperation in the region is essential and
will benefit all sides.
The working groups of the multilateral tracks
undertook various assignments of primary importance.
Unfortunately, their activities have been frozen for
irrelevant reasons. This is the time to resurrect them. Any
delay or imposed condition is liable to undermine the peace
process and delay the aid packages so essential to the
peoples of the region. Throughout this important process,
on the bilateral and the multilateral tracks alike, we are
accompanied by the international community. First and
foremost was the United States of America, along with the
Russian Federation, the European Union, Canada, Norway,
Japan, China and other countries and organizations that
have assisted and continue to do so. Their key contributions
earn them special commendation from this rostrum.
Egypt and Jordan were our first partners in breaking
down the walls of enmity and in thawing relations in our
region. Improving our relations with Egypt, as well as
renewing the multilateral tracks, are essential to furthering
the common objectives of the nations in our region. T h e
relations between Israel and Jordan are an example of
appropriate and favourable relations between neighbouring
countries. We intend to strengthen and broaden the relations
between the two nations in the economic, social and
political realms.
As we march further along the difficult path of
making peace, we look back with sorrow and sadness as we
remember the pioneers who broke new ground and are no
longer with us today: the late Menachem Begin, Anwar
Saddat, Yitzhak Rabin, King Hussein and King Hassan II
of Morocco. Their vision and their work inspire us to
continue to work towards completing their enterprise of
peacemaking.
We cannot afford to be disillusioned. Our region is
neither North America nor Benelux. Even as we negotiate
the peace process, we remain aware of the threats and
dangers directed against us, threatening the stability of the
entire region. The mix of extreme fundamentalism, on the
one hand, and of the potential use of weapons of mass
destruction, on the other, threatens the peace, stability and
future of the entire region. This threat is not just an
element of academic debates in the study of international
relations, but a harsh reality which we must all face.
From this international platform, I call for a halt to
all technological, scientific and other kinds of assistance
to countries looking to obtain unconventional weapons,
while threatening the existence of the State of Israel and
the region as a whole.
The Persian Gulf War demonstrated that leadership
lacking reason and stability poses a threat to all the
countries in the region and to the world at large. The
monitoring groups and machinery in Iraq must be
immediately resumed. That is the obligation of the
international community so long as the Iraqi regime seeks
non-conventional weapons and threatens the region. The
United Nations is the largest, most authoritative and most
recognized international body. It should therefore be the
one to take the initiative and the responsibility in curbing
this danger.
Terrorism is an additional strategic enemy and we
cannot come to terms with its existence. It is a threat not
only to Israel, but to many other nations across the world
as well. Terror knows no borders or civilized rules. There
can be no coexistence with terror, either in the context of
the negotiations conducted by Israel with its neighbours,
or in the broader regional context. Anyone who believes
that terror is a nuisance which can be tolerated is
mistaken. Terror is in essence a strategic threat. A
synthesized, coordinated and unrelenting approach must
be adopted against it.
Here, in this building of stone and glass, reflecting
the current image of our world today with its points of
light and shadows of darkness, counterparts and enemies
meet as friends and allies in the creation of a forum for
discussion and coexistence. Discussion is the way to
resolve conflict. It is also the way of tomorrow. Dialogue
and common language are the tools of diplomacy, the raw
material for the creation of a new reality and the
foundation for a stable and safer society.
It was here in the General Assembly, at the
beginning of the decade, that I first met with my Chinese
counterpart. After 40 years of total dissociation between
our two countries, we endeavoured to re-establish
diplomatic relations between Israel and China. It was also
here that we laid the groundwork for establishing ties
with the former Soviet Union, as well as with India,
Nigeria and other States. These are only a few examples
15


demonstrating the possibility in this arena for building a
bridge between nations and States.
As a nation that experienced great difficulties,
overcome only by accelerated development efforts, the State
of Israel takes part in the international effort to aid others
and share knowledge, experience and technology,
experience which it has accumulated in various fields. The
nation of Israel is proud of its ancient tradition of sharing
and identifying with the world at large.
Through the Division for International Cooperation
within the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Israel maintains ongoing
projects and a broad range of training courses in Israel. We
have demonstration units and we are conducting research.
For example, a special medical centre was recently
established in Mauritania and serves the many citizens of
that State who suffer from chronic eye problems. Similarly,
Israel invests great efforts and resources in training
professionals to acquire the skills and abilities necessary for
meeting the various challenges that engage many parts of
the world.
In the more than 40 years since its inception, the
Division for International Cooperation has trained more
than 70,000 trainees from more than 120 countries, who
have come to Israel and attended its training courses in the
areas of agriculture, water resources, health and medicine,
science, education and others.
In 1998 alone, some 155 courses were held in Israel
on a variety of topics, with the participation of more than
4,000 trainees. Gladly, I can report that many of the
trainees were from Middle Eastern countries. Fully 820
Palestinians participated in these courses over the past year,
thereby helping to strengthen the bridges of peace which
have been built between Israelis and Palestinians. In the
same year, Israel ran more than 150 courses in over 60
different countries, with the participation of over 7,000
trainees. I am proud to point out that in many of the
countries to which we sent Israeli experts, the local
personnel managed to translate our goodwill into positive
results on the ground, to the benefit of their people and
their land.
Because of the reputation it has acquired, the Division
for International Cooperation is also one of the central
addresses in Israel to which people can turn in times of
disaster around the world. We have recently witnessed just
how essential such assistance can be in times of natural
disasters. Israel has always responded favourably to
requests for aid and relief, regardless of the political
context or the state of diplomatic relations.
We wish to support and commend the United States
of America, our friend and ally, an inspiration to us all in
its efforts to promote the values of cooperation among
nations. This is also the time to express our appreciation
to the United States for its intensive efforts to bring true
peace to the Middle East.
Even today in the United States we have witnessed
again a new resort to the threat of boycott. The case at
hand is the threat to declare a boycott against the
American company Disney, because the company dared
to allow Jerusalem to be portrayed in an exhibition
celebrating the millennium. We condemn these threats and
the use by certain Arab States of this anachronistic
device. It has no place here or anywhere else in the
world.
Over thousands of years, since the time of biblical
King David, the builder of Jerusalem, until the present
day, Jerusalem has not served as the capital of any other
nation in the world besides the nation of Israel, the
Jewish people. Even after our forced exile from the land
of Israel, we continued, generation after generation, to
stay faithful to Jerusalem. The flame of Jerusalem was
carried in our hearts as a hidden source of faith and hope.
In our wanderings, in the East and in the West, in
the African deserts and on the outskirts of Siberia, from
the golden age of Spain through the dark Inquisition,
during the prosperous Europe of the romantic era to the
charred ashes of the Holocaust, throughout all the above
the eyes of the Jews and their prayers have been directed
toward Jerusalem. Year after year, from father to son, the
anthem of the Jewish nation has constantly been “Next
Year in Jerusalem”.
With the passing of those previous generations and
exiles, we have had the privilege of being deemed worthy
to return to Jerusalem, to rebuild the ruins, to rededicate
the city as a centre radiating with beauty, open to all
followers of all religions, as the poet has said, where
freedom of all religions is a fact of life.
It is so upsetting then that even today, 51 years since
the independence of the State of Israel, there are still
those who would deny our natural right to decide the
location of our capital, a natural right given to every
nation in the world. From Jerusalem, the city of David, I
will quote from the original song of David on Jerusalem,
16


in words which transcends the limits of time and retains
their meaning in every generation:
“Our feet shall stand within thy gates, oh Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built as a city that is bound firmly
together.” (The Holy Bible, Psalm 122:2-3)
Today, as before, from this podium we declare to the
entire world, to our friends and people and those who are
distant from us: Jerusalem, unified under Israeli
sovereignty, is and will remain forever the capital of Israel.

"
5,1979,"ISR_prev_1998","161.	Mr, President, please accept my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide the work of the Assembly efficiently and fairly.
162.	I would also like to express our appreciation to the President of the last session of the General Assembly, Ambassador Lievano of Colombia.
163.	It is my pleasure to congratulate Saint Lucia on its independence and admission to the United Nations.
164.	As we reflect on the development of the United Nations throughout the past year, we find the spectacle far from encouraging. The fundamental obstacle to the Organization's work is the selectivity which has been forced upon it by an automatic majority of the membership, which is far from impartial and prefers expediency to principles. The United Nations specialized agencies have suffered badly from this. Organs like UNESCO, WHO, the ILO and others have been severely affected by heavy politicization which has influenced their functioning. Instead of dedicating themselves solely to their specific fields in the service of mankind, they have been reduced to forums of political one-sidedness.
165.	There must be a return to the United Nations Charter. Consultation and agreement should be restored to their primary place. In particular, the specialized agencies must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they have been dragged, so that they may devote themselves to the economic, social, humanitarian, scientific and technological tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform so well when permitted to do so.
166.	There has been little improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Even though the number of exit visas for Soviet Jews has increased recently, the gap between the number of Jews applying for exit visas and those granted them is growing, while an even larger number of Soviet Jews have been denied the fundamental right to emigrate—a right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki Declaration. Those Jews who do insist on their rights are subjected to continued harassment by the authorities, to dismissal from their places of employment and, in some cases, to arrest and imprisonment. We have taken note of the fact that seven Jewish prisoners were released a few months ago. However, we are particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences imposed on other Jews whose only crime is their desire to re-join their families in Israel—Iosif Begun, Boris Kalendarov, Iosif Mendelevich, Ida Nudel, Anatoly Shcharansky, Simon Shnirman, Vladimir Slepak, Aleksandr Vilic and Amner Zavurov. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and permit everyone who seeks to emigrate to Israel and join his people and his family to do so.
167.	We cannot be silent in the face of the rising incitement against the State of Israel and the Jewish people, its religion, culture and national movement, as manifested day by day in the official Soviet media. In this regard, it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their religion and culture. We appeal to the Soviet Union to allow Jewish religion and culture to be practised and expressed freely, and to put an end to anti-Jewish propaganda.
168.	We also deeply regret that the Government of Syria continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and to be reunited with their relatives living in other lands. We appeal to the Syrian Government to change this policy.
169.	The past year witnessed a historic break-through in the Middle East. In March, Israel and Egypt signed the first ever Israel-Arab peace treaty. President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel concluded that Treaty after intense negotiations, which lasted a year and a half and which demanded great leadership and courage. Israel wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States of America and to its President, Mr. Jimmy Carter, personally for the vital role which they played in bringing about this historic achievement, which has created a new reality in our region.
170.	Let me recall here that Israel has throughout the first 30 years of its independence constantly extended its hand to its neighbours in the search for peace. This found expression on the very first day of the establishment of our State, in the Israel Declaration of Independence of 14 May 1948. Let me add specifically that as early as in the summer of 1967, very shortly after the six-day war, Israel had taken the initiative and offered to sign a treaty of peace with Egypt, declaring its readiness to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egyptian sovereignty in the context of a peace treaty. This Israeli proposal was rejected, and the answer given by Egypt at the time was: ""No negotiation, no recognition and no peace with Israel: what was taken by force will be taken back by force."" This year, however, has seen the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. After a generation of continued warfare, the realization of a dream begins.
171.	The Treaty of Peace, which, as stated in its preamble, is ""an important step in the search for comprehensive peace in the area,"" has provided for a role in its implementation to be fulfilled by the United Nations. United Nations forces and observers were called upon to carry out functions in order to see that the peace treaty was fully implemented. Ironically and paradoxically, that initiative taken by some States Members of the United Nations in the cause of peace was rejected by the United Nations. The Security Council was exposed to the threat of a Soviet veto, and the mandate of UNEF was not renewed, so that the Security Council in effect disassociated itself from the first positive and major step in the great effort to relieve the Middle East from the dangers of war.
172.	Although our assumption and hope that the United Nations would assist in the implementation of the Treaty of Peace have been disappointed, we will proceed along the path of peace. The attitude of the United Nations will not damage the peace process; but it will, no doubt, lower the prestige and even the moral stature of the United Nations, one of whose basic principles and purposes is, as stated by the Charter, to ""maintain international peace and security . . . and to bring about by peaceful means . . . settlement of international disputes. . . ''.
173.	As a result of the Treaty of Peace, the process of normalization in the relations between Egypt and Israel has already begun. We are confident that in the months ahead we shall make further progress in cementing new bonds of co-operation.
174.	The frequent visits and meetings of the leaders of both countries are also an expression of the common desire to promote understanding and closer personal relationships. The most recent—and most impressive—visit of President El-Sadat to Israel three weeks ago and the reception given him in the city of Haifa, where Jews and Arabs coexist in harmony and cooperation, indicated the deep feelings of all the population of Israel towards the era of peace and, we hope, left warm memories in the minds and hearts of our Egyptian guests.
175.	Over the past year the situation in Lebanon has become grave. The intervention of Syria has, in fact, plunged the northern part of that formerly prosperous country into a state of anarchy, and the Lebanese Government has become incapable of ruling and exercising its authority over all of its territory. The southern part of Lebanon has been, to a great extent, in the hands of the terrorist groups of the PLO, whose murderous activities have been a source of danger and harassment not only to Israel, but also to the Christian and Moslem Lebanese in that area.
176.	UNIFIL was established by Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978.
177.	Israel, having been compelled to act militarily against the PLO in southern Lebanon in a clear act of self-defence, agreed to withdraw its forces, provided that the new United Nations force would undertake to restore peace and security in the area and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the country.
178.	Unfortunately, the aim of restoring Lebanon's integrity has not been achieved, and the Lebanese Government is still incapable of exercising its sovereignty. PLO terrorist groups are still functioning all over Lebanon and, in quite a large number of cases, inside the area of United Nations units. In this region, which was free from any terrorist presence at the time of the Israeli withdrawal, there are now about 700 PLO terrorists, who are acting murderously through the lines of the United Nations Force against the people of Israel. The Force was supposed to act against this. The Secretary-General, in his initial report of 19 March 1978 spoke of the right of self-defence of the Force, including resistance by forceful means to attempts to prevent it from discharging its duties.
179.	In his report of 13 September 1978, the Secretary-General stated, among the guidelines and terms of reference of UNIFIL, that ""uniformed or armed personnel and military equipment are not allowed to enter the UNIFIL area of operation""."" However, there are too many cases in which the Force has in fact reconciled itself to the presence and activities of the terrorists in its own area. UNIFIL has not carried out its mandate and duties in this respect, despite the fact that its units have themselves suffered from terrorist activities and at least eight UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in these incidents. The presence and activities of the PLO terrorist groups in the region are in violation of the UNIFIL mandate, and it should be understood that Israel cannot be expected to sit back while terror is being unleashed against its population, no matter where in Lebanon these actions originate.
180- Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries ceased to provide arms, training and refuge to its practitioners. No cause can justify terrorism. The issue is, therefore, a fundamental one for the international community, and the struggle against terrorism should continue until terrorism has been brought to an end.
181.	The PLO, by its very nature and actions, is a terrorist organization. Its true character is reflected in its so-called' 'Covenant"", which calls for the purging of the Zionist presence from Palestine. The same document denies the existence of the Jewish people and its unbroken historical ties with the land of Israel. It alleges that the establishment of the State of Israel is null and void and rejects outright any plans to settle the Middle East conflict by peaceful means.
182.	The PLO has not hesitated to try to translate its vicious doctrine into criminal deeds. It has conducted an unceasing campaign of terror aimed at the mass murder of innocent civilians in Israel. From June 1967 to date, over 640 people have been murdered and 3,300 others have been wounded in Israel by the PLO. It has also terrorized and intimidated Arabs prepared to negotiate peace with Israel, killing more than 350 Arabs and injuring almost 2,000 others.
183.	Given the PLO's character and aims, it was, in fact, recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process. No country can or should be expected to negotiate with a party which denies its very existence, aims at its destruction, and uses terror against its civilian population. On the other hand, careful provision was made in the Camp David agreements to include Palestinian Arab residents of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza District in the peace process.
184.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East, Agreed at Camp David by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel, and witnessed by the President of the United States of America, refers positively and constructively to Palestinian Arab rights, as well as to the rights and security interests of the other parties. It is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which are the only agreed basis for peace negotiations in the Middle East. Any tampering with them can only gravely jeopardize the current peace process.
185.	This Framework agreement sees the solution of the question of the Palestinian Arab residents of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District in terms of granting them full autonomy, for a transitional period of five years, before reaching an agreement on the final status of the area. For that reason, it was agreed to negotiate on a principle of self-government—exercised through an administrative council—for the Arab inhabitants of the areas in question.
186.	Moreover, in the preamble to this Framework, the signatories invited other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere to it as well. In the letter sent by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel to President Carter on 26 March 1979—the date of the signing of the peace treaty—they invited the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Join the negotiations.
187.	This Framework provides for negotiations on the transitional period of five years, and also for the subsequent negotiations on a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, in which the location of the boundaries dividing the two countries will be agreed. The option of creating a third State between Israel and Jordan is, therefore, not considered in the Camp David agreements.
188.	Thus, the objective of the negotiations being held now, based on the Camp David Framework, is the provision of full autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. The Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants. This Framework also specifies measures that will be taken to assure the security of Israel and its neighbours.
189.	The only way to keep the process of peace going on is for us to adhere strictly to the Camp David agreements in their letter and spirit, and I should like to assure this Assembly that this is the policy of Israel.
190.	Before concluding, let me say a few words about Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people.
191.	Jerusalem has known many foreign rulers during the course of its long history, but none of them regarded it as their capital. Only the Jewish people has always maintained it as the sole centre of its national and spiritual life. For thousands of years, Jews have prayed daily for their return to Jerusalem and, for the past century and a half, Jerusalem has had a continuous and uninterrupted Jewish majority.
192.	Jerusalem cannot be divided again by barbed wire and there can be no return to the repeated shooting at our civilians and the barbaric desecration of the Jewish quarter of the City, the Holy Places and cemeteries, as happened before 1967, when the eastern part of Jerusalem was under the occupation of Jordan. It is relevant to recall that, in grave violation of the 1949 Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement; Jordan prevented Jews from having access to their Holy Places and cultural institutions and tried to eliminate systematically every trace of Jerusalem's Jewish past. By contrast, as a result of Israel's policy of free access to all Holy Places, millions of Moslem and Christian tourists and pilgrims—in addition to Jewish visitors—have come to Jerusalem since 1967, and have prayed and worshipped freely at its mosques and churches.
193.	Jerusalem is now a city of coexistence between Jews and Arabs. At the same time, the Government of Israel is and has always been conscious of the fact that Jerusalem is of deep concern also to other faiths, and that its religious and cultural sites are precious to Christians and Moslems, as well as to Jews. There should be completely free access to all the holy shrines by believers of all religions, without any exception, completely protected and guaranteed by the law of the country, and those holy shrines should be administered by the respective representatives of the religions concerned, without any interference.
194.	The choice before the United Nations is clear. This Organization, whose Charter enjoins it to support the cause of international peace and security, must not submit to the designs of those who reject peace. Let the United Nations give peace its full support. Let the Governments of Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judaea, Samaria and Gaza join the negotiations in order to achieve the noble goal of a real and durable comprehensive peace in our area."
5,1980,"ISR_prev_1998","Mr. President, at the outset I should like to express to you our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and the outstanding qualities that you have exhibited in the realm of multilateral diplomacy ensure your ability to keep a firm grasp on the helm of the Assembly during this stormy period.
53.	Al the opening of this session a new State joined the ranks of the United Nations: Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On behalf of the Government and people of Israel, I should like to welcome it to the Organization and wish it all prosperity and success as an independent and sovereign Stale.
54,	To my very grout regret, it is not possible to express satisfaction at the condition of the United Nations today, cither in general or from the specific perspective of my country. Indeed, it is questionable whether there remains much similarity or correlation between the noble ideals, principles and purposes which guided the founding fathers of the United Nations and the reality prevailing in the Organization today. The founders of this Organization saw in their vision a forum and a framework for the achievement and maintenance of peace between nations after the horrific experience of the Second World War, a horror which they had experienced at first hand.
55.	Perhaps the most cynical expression of the gap between the original vision and the reality prevailing in the United Nations today has been the refusal of this Organization, ostensibly dedicated to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to adopt and encourage the Camp David accords' and the subsequent Peace Treaty, which brought to an end decades of hostilities between Israel and Egypt and raised the possibility of expanding the peace process to embrace all of Israel's neighbours. This Organization, whose principal purpose is the promotion of peace among nations, has thus betrayed its own raison d'etre by rejecting an historic step towards peace and by playing into the hands of the enemies of peace, the rejectionists and the warmongers.
56. This unhappy phenomenon is not confined to the General Assembly. Out of the 18 debates which have been conducted thus far during 1980 in the Security Council, nine were devoted to subjects involving my country. Is there anyone who seriously believes that half of the world's international problems today are connected with Israel? We need only glance at a map of our region, the Middle East—which is just one region of the world—to sec that it is riddled from length to breadth with countless conflicts between States, between ethnic minorities and between different religious groups. Virtually all those conflicts have a history and a dynamic of their own, totally divorced from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
57. By way of illustration. I need only mention the situation in Afghanistan and. of course, the full-scale war between Iran and Iraq—a worrying outbreak of hostilities which has wide-ranging implications. That war between two States ruled by extremist, irresponsible and trigger-happy regimes threatens both regional and international security by putting at risk much of the world's regular supply of oil, That war, a struggle between two Moslem States, demolishes, in our opinion, the naive and groundless belief that the world's oil supply is dependent on a pro-Arab solution to the dispute between Israel and its neighbours. It has become all too clear that the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict will not provide any miracle cure for the region as a whole or eliminate the many other grave conflicts raging in it. The ability of the United Nations to work for an end to the bloodshed in Iraq and Iran will be a yardstick of the Organization's ability to continue to fulfil its role for the encouragement and maintenance of peace.
58.	Important tasks have been allotted to the United Nations. Besides its role in the preservation of international peace and security, it also has a vital role to play in other spheres which require our earnest attention, in particular through the specialized agencies established for various purposes. But even the specialized agencies have been gravely compromised by the plague of politicization. Business-like debates and deliberations in them have become increasingly difficult—if not all but impossible to conduct—to the grave detriment not only of the agencies themselves but also of those whom they were set up to serve.
59.	While I am bound to express deep regret at the condition of the United Nations today. I must also express the hope that all Members of the Organization which share our concern and feelings of responsibility for its future will intensify their efforts both to bring the United Nations back to the ideals of its founders and to channel the specialized agencies back to their specific areas of concern.
60.	Among the subjects which have rightly been given a prominent place in the agenda of the United Nations are the state of the world's economy and the relations between the industrialized and the developing nations. The convening of the recent eleventh special session of the General Assembly attests to this fact. Israel took part in that special session with the intention of making a constructive contribution to its work. We therefore share the disappointment over the results of that event, which were not adequate. We sincerely hope that in the near future the efforts to have a constructive dialogue rather than confrontation will be resumed, so that those whose needs are greatest will not suffer the most.
61.	Despite our small size and limited resources, we have for decades devoted far greater efforts than might have been expected to assisting nations of the third world in the development of their economies and societies. Israel has shared freely the know-how which it has developed, as well as its experience as a small State in an arid and subtropical region, which has enabled us to make great strides over a period of a few short years.
62.	The problems encountered by Israel in the course of its social and economic development are similar to the problems facing much of the developing world today. Many of the solutions worked out in Israel can be applied directly by others. Despite the disappointments which my country has experienced, Israel continues to have deep sympathy for the struggle of the developing countries to ameliorate and advance the condition of their peoples and economies. Israel stands ready to continue to give of its know-how and to take a vigorous and constructive part in the efforts of the international community in the spheres of health, social services, agriculture, development of new and renewable sources of energy, and in every other sphere to which we can contribute.
63.	From this rostrum I should like to give expression to the anguish of our Jewish brothers in various parts of the globe. There is. it would seem, no end to the pain of the Jew in history. The suffering and persecution continue even today. And we, the people of Israel, feel responsible for the lot of every Jew who suffers anywhere.
64.	In the last year additional harsh limitations have been imposed on Jews who seek to leave the Soviet Union and emigrate to the State of Israel. Those restrictions conflict with the most basic human and national rights of peoples, and we are in duty bound to echo the cries of the Jews in the Soviet Union and appeal to the Government of that country to remove the restrictions and facilitate the immigration of Jews to Israel.
65.	We must also express anxiety over the condition of the tortured Jewish community in Syria, whose human rights are severely curtailed, and many of whom have been imprisoned and have had their property impounded. I would thus also appeal to the Government of Syria to respect the basic-human rights of its Jewish community, which it holds as hostages and which it prevents from leaving.
66.	The Jews of Iran have suffered painfully in recent months, and their situation is deteriorating from day to day. Many Jews have been thrown in gaol; others have been given the death sentence, in most cases on ""charges"" of contact with Israel. We know of the difficulties in dealing with the present regime in Iran, to which fundamental concepts of human rights and the norms of international relations seem foreign. But we hope that sight will not be lost of the situation of the Jews there who are perhaps among the most vulnerable of the minorities in that troubled land.
67.	Two years ago a development took place in the Middle East—a breakthrough which can appropriately be called historic. After serious negotiations between the parties, with the active and important participation of the United States, the Camp David framework and the subsequent Israeli-Egyptian Peace Treaty were signed by the leaders of the two countries and witnessed by the President of the United States. Israel made major concessions and took considerable risks by signing those agreements, l.et me cite only our withdrawal from the oilfields in Sinai, for there is no need for me to waste words on the significance and implications of that step in this day and age. Similarly I need only point to the strategic depth in Sinai which Israel has relinquished, as well as to the advanced air bases located in Sinai, the evacuation of which will be implemented in due course in accordance with the terms of the Peace Treaty.
68.	Israel believed that its concessions and sacrifices would be met with appreciation and understanding by the world community and that a long-awaited breakthrough would be achieved on the international scene. Not only has that not 06itte about, but many countries in the world have spared no effort to destroy that hard-won peace, and Israel continues to be the object of unending accusations and attacks.
69.	Nevertheless, the decision and determination of Israel remain firm to continue on the road to peace. Thus, in accordance with the Camp David framework, negotiations have taken place for the attainment of full autonomy for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea. Samaria and the Gaza District.
70.	Substantial progress has been achieved in these talks in certain fields, but the talks have, it is true, had their tips and downs and have even been suspended a number of times by Egypt. There is nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the difficulties encountered thus far in the progress of the talks. They reflect the complexities inherent in the subjects under discussion. The difficulties are familiar to any country which, at one time or another, has been engaged in complex negotiations involving multifaceted and long-standing problems.
71.	One area in which progress has been achieved in the negotiations is the modalities of the free elections to be held in the territories concerned. These procedures would make the proposed autonomy into one of the few—all too few— examples of free democratic process in the Middle East. Progress has also been achieved in the area of powers and responsibilities of the autonomy covering many aspects of the everyday life of the inhabitants of the territories in question.
72.	We certainly believe that autonomy can and must be established. All the parties to the Camp David framework are convinced that the process set out in that framework is the only one which is within the realm of the possible. All alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem at hand—ideas such as the holding of an international conference or the like—are devoid of real prospect or purpose. No one can really believe that the various elements in the Middle East which arc so much at odds with each other would attend a peace conference and achieve a positive outcome that would lead to a solution acceptable to all. Thus too the ideas entertained by the European Community, which do not take Israel's position into account, are only likely to encourage those who are opposed to peace.
73.	Those who genuinely seek peace should encourage the progress which has been achieved through the Camp David process. Let them also bear in mind and give due regard to the fact that, by proposing the idea of autonomy in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, Israel has taken on itself great risks for the sake of peace.
74.	We hope that the autonomy talks will be resumed in the near future. We also hope that the process of normalization of relations between Israel and Egypt will be intensified and will serve as the best possible proof and a living symbol of the fact that peace can and must take the place of war. The full significance of these peaceful relations should be grasped for what they are—and for what they may lead to—as the very corner-stone for peace in the region.
75. The leaders of Israel and Egypt have reiterated time and again their mutual commitment to the proposition that there will be no more war. Let us hope that the change which has come about in the Middle East with the signing of peace will be the opening for a positive and long-lasting transformation in the history of our conflict-ridden area. The strict adherence to the agreements by Israel, in accordance with their letter and spirit alike, is a guarantee of the continuation of the peace process. However, by itself it is not enough. We hope that all the others involved will act in the same way.
76. Much has been alleged against Israel in the name of the principle of self-determination for nations. We favour that concept, and we have proved that in the support that we extended to many States which have achieved their independence in our generation, in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. The Governments of those States and their peoples know that full well. But there is no connection between that principle and the perverted attempt to turn self-determination into the basis for the destruction of the Stale of Israel, as certain States are endeavouring to do. Anyone who is familiar with the ideology and the terminology of the murder organization that calls itself the PLO, as well as with the declarations of the various Arab rejectionist States, can see beyond all doubt that the term ""self-determination"", as they use it, is nothing more than a euphemism for the destruction of Israel.
77.	It should not be forgotten that the Palestinian Arabs have achieved their self-determination in Jordan, a State which is the Arab State in Palestine, by virtue of its history, territory, population, culture and all aspects of its national life. The establishment of a second Palestinian Arab Slate by distorting the principle of self-determination means the creation of an extremist and hostile base opposed to the very-existence of Israel. Hence we will not agree to a distorted form of self-determination, which in reality implies self-destruction for our ancient nation deeply rooted in its own land.
78.	The programme of autonomy which we have proposed for the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, as accepted in principle in the Camp David frameworks, is the first practical proposal to be advanced to provide a dignified solution for the needs of the Arab population of those areas. It comes in place of all the empty declarations with which the Palestinian Arabs concerned have deluded themselves and have been deluded by other States and organizations over the years.
79.	One of the most vivid expressions of the rejection of all peace proposals by the Arab rejectionist States is to be seen in their unprecedented military build-up and in the armaments which they have received in recent years from the Soviet bloc or purchased from the United States and Western Europe. In the course of the last three years, orders for arms purchases by the larger Arab States have reached astronomic sums. The quantities of arms that were actually supplied have been equally staggering. There is no precedent for the amassing of arms on this scale in our region. Those arms are designated first and foremost for use against Israel. But the implications of that vast array of armaments ait not confined to my country alone. It also serves to inject war into the area at large.
80.	We call upon the United Nations to take due note of the military build-up by the Arab rejectionist States and to urge them to decrease their armament. For our part, we are prepared to lend a hand in any joint effort to bring about the limitation of arms in our region which is poised on top of a volcano.
81. I should like to address myself to another crucial aspect of disarmament. Israel has consistently supported resolutions of the General Assembly aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This global problem, we believe, can best be solved by means of negotiated regional arrangements. Hence, since 1975, Israel has consistently advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East on the Tlatelolco model. Israel believes that an international conference of all the Slates in the region and adjacent to our region should be held, leading to the conclusion of a formal, contractual, multilateral convention among all States of the region.
82.	We hope that in the course of this General Assembly, we shall find a suitable opportunity to give concrete expression to our views on this matter. In the meantime, I should like to reiterate my Government's position, which is that Israel will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Arab-Israeli dispute.
83.	In the last months, Jerusalem has been the object of attacks on Israel in various international forums. There has been much hypocrisy and cynicism in those attacks, For, truth to tell, never has the situation of the various religions represented in Jerusalem been better than that prevailing since the unification of the city by Israel in 1967. For 19 years, between 1948 and 1967, the eastern part of the city was under Jordanian occupation and barbed wire divided it in two. Places holy to the Jews were maliciously desecrated. Ancient synagogues and cemeteries were destroyed in a barbaric manner, and Jews were denied access to the Holy Places which are the spiritual life-blood of the Jewish people. It is not out of place to remark that the Moslem Arab citizens of Israel were also denied access to their Holy Places during that ignoble period. And where, I am bound to ask, was the voice of this Organization during that period"".' Not once was it raised in condemnation of those illegal acts.
84.	On the other hand, since 1967. all—irrespective of religion and nationality—have been accorded free access to the city of Jerusalem and the possibility of worshipping at the Holy Places and shrines revered by them. Israel has assured the free and unfettered observance of the religious rites of all members of all faiths, who also administer their religious lives and their Holy Places without any outside interference. That is the truth well known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem and to everyone who has visited the city. There is no substance or basis to any claim to the contrary.
85.	There is no need for me to dwell at length on the bond between the Jewish people and Jerusalem. The Jewish people is the only people which has made Jerusalem its capital since it appeared as a nation on the stage of human history. Throughout the many years of exile inflicted on it. The Jewish people prayed three times a day, every day, for its restoration to Jerusalem.
86. For the last 150 years there has been a Jewish majority in Jerusalem. Whoever seeks to sever Jerusalem from Israel seeks to decapitate the Jewish people. We hope that nations that seek peace and know the reality which prevails in Jerusalem today will respect the city as the sovereign capital of Israel; a city which will not be divided again, in the same way as Israel respects the Holy Places of all religions and their freedoms in the city.
87.	I wish to conclude with a call in the spirit of the Prophets of Israel, who were a light and an inspiration for much of mankind. My call is for peace—peace which is at the very basis of the existence of the United Nations.
88.	We in Israel yearn for peace. We have done so since the first day of the restoration of our national sovereignty—in our Declaration of Independence, which was issued on the very day that the State of Israel was founded in 1948. In that Declaration, we extend the hand of peace and good neighbourliness to all the States around us and all their peoples. We have taken far-reaching steps and have made huge sacrifices for the sake of peace. But peace with Israel does not mean peace without Israel, or peace at its expense. Nor does it mean peace with a weak Israel deprived of its capital and with its wings clipped from the security and geostrategic viewpoints. With such an Israel peace will not be attained, because a weak Israel will be an object of unceasing attacks and destructive designs.
89.	I wish to call upon the Arab States which are our neighbours, and also upon the Palestinian Arabs living in Judaea, Samaria and the Gaza District, to follow the dictates of reason and to join the peace process. I wish to call upon the other nations of the world to support this course and to prevail upon the Arab States to adopt it. The world at large, and not merely our region alone, will benefit from this.
